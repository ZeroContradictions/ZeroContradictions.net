0:00: The first 10 minutes were redundant, no new information. Review and Overview.
11:55: It was harder to recognize that money is intersubjective back when money was backed by gold, and not fiat.
12:00: An excerpt of Adam Smith talking about nails and the division of labor. He talked about nails, because they have a simple design, which helps convey the point that even simple designs can&rsquo;t be mass produced without division of labor. Now imagine how much more difficult it would be to mass produce much more complex things, like smartphones, housing, trains, clothing, etc.
19:00 - 27:00: talking about division of labor and how it necessitates a medium of exchange.
27:00: Unit of account is implicit in medium of exchange function of money.
29:00: Static vs dynamic functions of money.
30:00: Gesell writes the power of money to affect exchanges its technical quality from the Mercantile standpoint is in inverse proportion to its technical quality from the banking standpoint just as the technical quality of a gas brake pedal from a gas standpoint would be in inverse proportion to its technical quality from a braking standpoint.
31:00: Analogy about flowing stream of water through a town, hoarding water into ponds, and tragedy of the commons.
34:20: We&rsquo;re all taught from childhood that saving using money as a store of value is a good thing. We think of saving as responsible behavior and of thrift as a virtue.

1:28: The definition and four components of interest.
4:30: Silvio Gesell&rsquo;s definition of interest focused on pure, risk-free &ldquo;basic&rdquo; interest.
5:43: Interestingly, many religions and historical figures opposed interest, and perhaps not without reason.
7:17: People underestimate the significance of interest, even for people who don&rsquo;t borrow or lend money.
8:04: A penny at 1% interest compounded monthly in the year zero in the year 2000 that investment would have grown to $4.8 million.
10:45: Graph showing how compound interest always grows exponentially.
12:46: Example where $1000 is loaned at 7% interest over 30 years.
13:43: The dynamics of money creation through bank lending mean that artificial scarcity is built into the system.
14:29: Let&rsquo;s show some graphs on debt.
15:14: Graph on household debt in the US from 1945 to 2018.
15:55: Graph on total corporate debt.
16:05: Graph on total US national debt.

18:10: Reading the story of Robinson Crusoe to explain interest.
31:50: Both the classical and Marxist economic perspectives ignore the existence of money, so the idea that interest is caused by money never occur to them.
32:40: The Productivity Theory of Interest.
39:34: The Abstinence Theory of Interest.
41:06: The Time-Preference Theory of Interest.
43:44: The contemporary mainstream neoclassical economics has developed what&rsquo;s referred to as a &ldquo;Real Theory of Interest&rdquo;, which is essentially a combination of the productivity and time preference theories.
44:12: The Fructification Theory of Interest.
44:43: Henry George was a proponent of the Fructification Theory of Interest.
48:42: The Keynesian liquidity preference theory of interest won&rsquo;t be discussed until later, since it&rsquo;s built on the foundation of the Gesellian view of interest.

3:08: How Gesell describes how the physical nature of producers&rsquo; wares compels them to sell as soon as possible on the market.
6:14: So let&rsquo;s imagine for a moment a non-monetary economy composed only of goods and services in which all exchanges are accomplished by barter.
10:19: Gold is the last material on Earth that we&rsquo;d want for money as a medium of exchange.
11:36: Why falling prices during a recession lower commerce.
12:39: As a rule, the most favorable time for the sale of a product is the moment it leaves the factory &#x2013; Silvio Gesell
15:50: Let&rsquo;s listen to how Gesell describes the Dynamics of a commercial crisis.
17:34: Let&rsquo;s remind ourselves of something we discussed previously: In a non-monetary economy such a situation would not arise for two reasons first in direct exchange between goods and services.
Both sides of every transaction are subject to the same compulsion to transact and second since in a barter economy buying and selling are part of the same action.
Say&rsquo;s law automatically applies. Buying and selling are always in balance.
18:20: It&rsquo;s the power differential between producers of unable goods and services and holders of hoardable money that Gesell says is the root cause of Interest.
20:49: Recap on how interest is a measure of the Distortion thereby created it&rsquo;s a quantification of the amount of power that has been taken away from producers of goods and services and given to holders of money.
22:10: So in order to illustrate this point let&rsquo;s think it through in concrete terms.
30:40: Returning to positively and negatively charged blood; Would require a drug to force circulation: interest in this analogy.
</p>

<p>
31:16: Let&rsquo;s think about how this power differential this ability to extract tribute translates into interest.
31:26: Let&rsquo;s imagine a scenario of saving an investment in a non-monetary economy.
31:32: Let&rsquo;s say there&rsquo;s a cattle rancher who because of his skill and hard work produces more beef than he needs to exchange for all of the goods and services that he and his family consume since he consumes less than he produces he has savings.
31:48: Let&rsquo;s say that he wants to save up to buy a car.
33:08: Now let&rsquo;s change the scenario and add gold money into the equation. Now instead of directly providing the beef, the Rancher sells his excess beef for money. He now has his Savings in the form of money rather than beef.
</p>

<p>
NOTE: I don&rsquo;t understand how adding gold money in this scenario would enable the rancher to get a harder bargain in his favor. Would he receiving money from the factory each week, instead of receiving a lump sum in the non-monetary scenario?
And how exactly would he be receiving a &ldquo;lump sum&rdquo; from the factory to buy a car eventually, after selling his excess beef to the factory each week?
If he&rsquo;s going to eventually receive a lump sum, then wouldn&rsquo;t that imply that there actually is money in the non-monetary scenario? (I&rsquo;m probably misunderstanding something here, but I&rsquo;m not sure what it is.)
Note: After reading the transcript a second time, it&rsquo;s now more clear why adding money to the economy gives an advantage to the cattle rancher, at the expense of putting the factory at a disadvantage.
But I still don&rsquo;t understand what this &ldquo;lump sum&rdquo; talk is all about.
</p>

<p>
35:02: Concluding session with discussing the different theories of interest that were previously mentioned.
39:19: Example of saving up $20,000 to buy a car.
40:40: Similarities between Gesell and Keynes&rsquo; views on interest.
</p>

<p>
41:48: Otto Valentine was an insightful German commentator on interest from the 1950s.
43:48: Final thought for today
43:50: Money is not wealth.
44:20: Money can be thought of as being like public roads. Public roads are not forms of private property or wealth. They&rsquo;re public utilities created by society to improve the living standards of all its members. The charging of interest is like allowing people to park their cars on public roads, and then charging other people to move their cars, just so traffic can flow.
44:44: Permitting the extraction of interest is allowing private parties to treat a public resource as a form of private property, and charge for its use. Obviously, we wouldn&rsquo;t tolerate such a situation on our roads, but we do tolerate an analogous situation when it comes to the vital public resource of money.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qS8ol1NNAc">&ldquo;Silvio Gesell: Beyond Capitalism vs Socialism&rdquo; Class #5</a>
How the existence of interest affect wages, the availability of capital, how it influences the distribution of wealth, how it causes economic instability, and how it&rsquo;s the driving force behind the so-called growth imperative.
0:23: Recap on last lecture.
1:26: At the end of the last class I read a quote from KES in which he said that the interest rate on money plays a peculiar role in limiting the level of employment, since it sets a standard which the marginal efficiency of capital must reach if it is to be newly produced.
This is an extremely important concept and one that we need to examine in Greater detail in order to understand why Silvio Gesell considers interest a root cause of poverty, unemployment, and recurring economic crisis.
#:##: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
6:59: Now let&rsquo;s recall the hypothetical saving investment scenario in a non-monetary economy that I described in the last class.
10:59: Here&rsquo;s how Gesell describes this transference of the power of money to interest to physical capital.
NOTE: Find exact quote, rather than trying to transcribe it from YouTube auto-transcript.
Money lays down the condition for the construction of a house or factory or ship, that 1. the house must be able to extract from its tenants, or 2. the factory from its workman, or 3. the ship from its freight, the same interest that money itself can at any time extract from wares.
No interest means no money for houses, factories, or ships.
And without money, how could anyone collect and put together the thousand different articles necessary for the construction
no interest means no money for houses factories or ships and
11:28 Without money how could anyone collect and put together the thousand different articles necessary for the construction of a ship, a factory, a house.
Without money, it&rsquo;s inconceivable that a house or ship or factory could ever be constructed so the foundation capital of every capitalistic undertaking consists of a sum of money for the millions of factories, ships, and rented houses.
14:18: Let&rsquo;s think about the mechanics, whereby the interest-generating power of money is transferred to real capital.
16:04: With that in mind, let&rsquo;s read the opening paragraph of the Natural Economic Order for the third time.
17:49: so are you now gaining a deeper understanding of what Gesell was talking about here imagine how different the world would be if the owner of trillions of dollars which are currently being unproductively hoarded in cash.
18:50: Let&rsquo;s think about how the same dynamic applies to the housing market.
22:59: Gesell&rsquo;s definition of Capitalism.
23:50: Here&rsquo;s how Gesell describes the end of capitalism Guided by this corrected
25:32: So the idea that the free market system and socialism are opposed to one another is partly due to the conflation of the free market system and capitalism.
26:22: Before moving on I want to briefly insert some of my own personal views on economic policy that I think relate to the problematic framing of Economic Policy debates as capitalist versus socialist, left versus right, or Progressive versus conservative. [Minimum wage example]
28:20 Let&rsquo;s listen to how Gesell describes the different perspectives of Marx and Proudhon on the phenomenon of the building plague.
30:42: This casts the economic program of today&rsquo;s left in a different light, doesn&rsquo;t it?
31:51: Next, I want to look at how our form of money causes economic instability and recurring crisis
32:05: As I said repeatedly during the Q&amp;A portions of these classes conventional monetary policy tends to focus on the quantity of money, rather than its velocity of circulation.
32:15: Whereas Gesel&rsquo;s analysis and proposals focus on the issue of velocity that Keynes famously referred to &ldquo;Animal Spirits&rdquo;.
When diagnosing the causes of economic inst stability and crisis, &ldquo;Animal Spirits&rdquo; refers to the unstable and unpredictable element of human psychology, and how it impacts the economy.
Economic sentiment can turn on a dime.
People can go from optimism to pessimism and vice versa, pretty much instantaneously.
This obviously can be a contributor to economic instability, and can make the job of policy makers very difficult, since they&rsquo;re often in a position of trying to counteract volatile swings and sentiment.
Witness how quickly we can go, from Talk of the Fed having to urgently loosen monetary policy in order to avert deflation, to all of a sudden having to tighten in order to control inflation.
33:13 Let&rsquo;s remind ourselves of something we discussed in the last class. When describing the different Natures of Supply in the form of unable goods and services and demand in the form of hoardable money.
36:12: Animal Spirits drive economic sentiment to swing from one extreme to the other causing what we erroneously refer to as the &ldquo;business cycle&rdquo;. We should describe it more accurately as the money cycle.
36:27: As we&rsquo;ll see in the next class one of the primary goals of Gesell&rsquo;s proposal for a different kind of money is to remove the discretionary element of demand.
36:37: According to Gesell&rsquo;s view, since the physical laws of the universe dictate that supply of goods and services is independent of the will of their producers, in order to achieve balance and stability demand in the shape of money also needs to be independent of the will of its holders.
36:58: One more important way in which interests negatively affects the real economy is the way in which it drives our unsustainable pursuit of growth.
37:07: Introduction to Felix Fuders, who takes the floor.
43:31: To put it in the words of Nobel Prize winner Fredick Sodi: Money is a credit depth relation from which none can effectually escape.
44:18: If money supply grows faster than GDP, and this will happen after some point, we will see inflation and price bubbles, e.g. price bubbles on real estate, stocks, gold, etc.
44:41: The obligation to grow comes from: 1. increasing interest burdens on debt, 2. inflation, and 3. interest as opportunity costs (which Fuders argues that this is the most important reason).
Imagine you have a business and the money invested in your business does not yield a return which you would gain in the bank account. Would you keep ownership of your business? Probably not, so you will shut it down. So, interest is the opportunity cost of any productive investment.
It is the benchmark, and if we do not earn at least what the bank would pay us for the same investment, then it doesn&rsquo;t make sense.
46:06: The interest rate sets the Rhythm after which the economy has to dance, and it&rsquo;s not just a fetish as some people believe.
46:15: Now we can understand also where unemployment come from we now from. We have to grow like 3% to cut down unemployment 0.5%. This is known. We know this empirically, but we don&rsquo;t really understand why this is. But now we can understand it.
46:34: If businesses cannot or do not manage to grow, what would be the second best alternative?
If they do not want to lose status quo, they will cut costs.
And how do we cut costs in the most effective way?
It&rsquo;s by replacing human capital by machines.
And this is why we see this dichotomy.
We either grow, or we see unemployment.
And if the machine gets old, then it will also look for a new job.
47:08: How hoardable money creates inequality.
51:09: The rate of interest creates incentives to engage in short-term oriented unsustainable practices, whereas a reduction or elimination of Interest results resulting from a Gesellian monetary reform would incentivize more sustainable long-term thinking.
51:29: Josh is a professional musician and a musical instruments dealer, having bought and sold a lot of vintage guitars.
He&rsquo;s very familiar with the history of unsustainable harvesting of Brazilian rosewood.
Brazilian rosewood is the most prized type of wood for building the backs and sides of guitars.
Unfortunately during the first several decades of the 20th century, the wood was over-harvested until there was almost none left.
It&rsquo;s now a protected species and there are strict regulations in place protecting the few remaining trees.
[Elaboration]
53:02: Let&rsquo;s think about how the rate of interest is related to incentives facing owners of endangered resources like Rosewood.
54:43: This example illustrates why my personal belief is that the time preference theory of Interest actually has causality exactly backwards.
55:46: That&rsquo;s all. Opening the floor to Q&amp;As.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GjX4PCcTlU">&ldquo;Silvio Gesell: Beyond Capitalism vs Socialism&rdquo; Class #6</a>
1:00: How did Silvio Gesell propose to solve the problems with our existing form of money?
1:06: To once again reiterate the central issue gasel says that by designing money to perform the store of value function in addition to the medium of exchange function we inadvertently made it Superior to real goods and services as a form in which to hold wealth.
1:25: A consequence of this superiority is that money does not meet with goods and services on a Level Playing Field when it mediates their exchange
3:39: Making money a neutral medium of exchange is the whole purpose of gel&rsquo;s proposed monetary reform and he tells us that in order to accomplish that money must meet with goods and services on a level playing field.
3:52: How can we establish a Level Playing Field between goods and services?
3:58: As Gesell observes: We cannot tamper with Goods. &#x2026;
5:27: How does Gesell propose to accomplish putting money and goods are on an equal playing field?
5:38: Gesell writes: Only money that goes out of date like a newspaper, rots like potatoes, rusts like iron, evaporates like ether is capable of standing the test as an instrument for the exchange of potatoes, newspapers, iron, and ether.
So we must make money worse as a commodity, if we wish to make it better as a medium of exchange.
NOTE: Find exact quote, rather than trying to transcribe it from YouTube auto-transcript.
</p>

<p>
So how can we make demand automatic how can we separate the circulation of money from the will of its holders?
The answer is demurrage.
Demurrage is a word that originally comes from the shipping industry.
It refers to a charge that is assessed to the operator of a ship that fails to load or unload within the agreed upon timeframe.
A ship that takes longer than it&rsquo;s supposed to unload to load or unload affects the ability of other ships to do likewise.
Therefore a financial penalty is assessed to discourage such Behavior.
Demurrage money applies the same principle, but to money.
</p>

<p>
7:26: Gesell writes: Money is not a featherbed. It is a moment&rsquo;s halting place by the roadside so demurrage money is like a ship that has a limited time frame during which it can load and unload.
</p>

<p>
7:51: The way that penalty is assessed is through a gradual but steady reduction in the purchasing power of money.
7:57: The specific rate of that reduction proposed by gasell was 5.2% per year or 0.1% per week.

Both the classical and Marxist economic perspectives ignore the existence of money.
For them gold and silver money were just commodities, no different in their fundamental natures than wheat or iron or oil.
So if that&rsquo;s the way you look at the economy, the idea that interest is caused by money would never occur to you.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
The abstinence theory states that interest is a reward that holders of wealth receive to compensate them for not consuming it.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
The question I posed in the first class about whether a squirrel ever stores nuts and comes back to later to find more nuts is designed among other things to highlight the fact that perspectives like the abstinence Theory are completely at odds with the laws of nature.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
&gt; What are each of the different theories of interest?
There are several major theories of interest in economics and finance.
Each theory attempts to explain why interest exists and how interest rates are determined:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b><b>Liquidity Preference Theory</b></b>: Developed by John Maynard Keynes, this theory focuses on the demand for money (liquidity) and suggests that interest is the reward for parting with liquidity.
People hold money for transactions, precautionary purposes, and speculative reasons.</li>
<li><b><b>Classical Theory (Real Theory)</b></b>: Developed by economists like Adam Smith and David Ricardo, this theory views interest as the price paid for the use of capital.
It suggests interest rates are determined by the supply and demand for loanable funds, influenced by factors like productivity of capital and time preference of individuals.</li>
<li><b><b>Time Preference Theory</b></b>: Associated with economists like Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and Irving Fisher, this theory states that interest exists because people prefer present consumption to future consumption.
Interest compensates lenders for delaying consumption.</li>
<li><b><b>Productivity Theory</b></b>: This theory suggests that interest arises because capital is productive.
Interest is the return on investment in productive capital assets.</li>
<li><b><b>Loanable Funds Theory</b></b>: Proposed by Knut Wicksell, this theory suggests interest rates are determined by the supply of and demand for loanable funds in the market.
The supply comes from savings, while the demand comes from investment opportunities.</li>
<li><b><b>Expectations Theory</b></b>: This explains the term structure of interest rates, suggesting that long-term interest rates reflect expectations of future short-term rates.</li>
<li><b><b>Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)</b></b>: A more recent approach that views interest rates as a policy tool that governments use to manage inflation rather than a market-determined price.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Each theory emphasizes different aspects of economic behavior and market conditions that influence interest rates.
In practice, interest rates are likely determined by a combination of these factors.
</p>

<p>
We instead support <a href="https://joshsidman.substack.com/p/why-does-money-earn-interest-part">Silvio Gesell&rsquo;s Theory of Interest</a>.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
Henry George was a proponent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_fructification">Fructification Theory of Interest</a>.
Fructification says that the root cause of the phenomenon of interest is the fertility of nature.
This view goes back to the late 18th century and the French Economist turgo.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
&gt; What is the fructification theory of interest?
The Fructification Theory of interest is one of the older theories of interest, associated primarily with the French economist Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot in the 18th century.
</p>

<p>
This theory explains interest by comparing the productivity of capital to the natural growth or &ldquo;fructification&rdquo; of agricultural land.
The core idea is that interest exists because money invested in land (a productive asset) will naturally generate returns through agricultural production.
</p>

<p>
According to this theory:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Land has a natural ability to produce goods (fruits, crops, etc.) over time.</li>
<li>Money can be used to purchase land.</li>
<li>Therefore, money itself should command a premium when lent, corresponding to the natural productive capacity of land it could purchase.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The rate of interest, according to this theory, should approximate the rate of return obtainable from investing in land.
If lending money yielded less than investing in land, people would simply buy land instead of lending.
Conversely, if interest rates were much higher than land returns, everyone would prefer lending over land ownership.
</p>

Turgot&rsquo;s fructification theory was important in the development of economic thought, as it connected interest to the productive capacity of capital rather than viewing it as merely a payment for the use of money.
However, it has limitations, particularly in modern economies where land is no longer the predominant form of wealth or investment.
</p>

<p>
This theory was eventually superseded by more comprehensive theories of interest that account for factors like time preference, liquidity concerns, and broader capital markets beyond agricultural land.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Henry George was an adherent of the fructification theory.
Fructification says that the root cause of the phenomenon of interest is the fertility of nature.
This view goes back to the late 18th century and the French Economist Turgo.
According to this view, a holder of money has a choice between lending that money or buying land.
And since ownership of land entitles the owner to the wealth created by the productive forces of nature, people will not choose to lend money, unless the return they&rsquo;re offered matches the return they can earn through land ownership.
Henry George echoes this view in Progress &amp; Poverty when he writes:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Interest springs from the power of increase, which the reproductive forces of nature and the in effect analogous capacity for exchange give to Capital.
It&rsquo;s not an arbitrary, but a natural thing.
It is not the result of a particular social organization, but of laws of the universe which underlie society.
It is therefore just.
&#x2013; Henry George
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Honestly, I find it quite amazing that he wrote those words, because they strike me as being completely at odds with his main thesis.
His statement reflects an idea that I expressed last week that virtually all wealth on Earth comes from two sources: the Bounty of Nature and the power of collaborative production and exchange made possible through the division of labor.
In comparison with those two things, individual effort is a minuscule contributing factor to the creation of wealth, so if George is correct that the cause of interest is the fertility of nature and the collaborative potential of society, how on Earth can he conclude that that the privatization of the wealth that springs from these two sources is natural?
And just I can&rsquo;t square that with the rest of Henry George&rsquo;s economic perspective.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore I don&rsquo;t agree with his statement that interest is independent of our model of social organization.
If we were to implement his proposed Land Reform, which aims at taxing away the full value of raw land, then wouldn&rsquo;t that result in the elimination of interest, if interest is in fact caused by the productive forces of nature?
</p>

<p>
So I personally lean toward the conclusion that Henry George didn&rsquo;t fully understand the subject of money, and therefore couldn&rsquo;t resolve the contradiction between his view of land and his analysis of Interest.

&gt; Why did/do so many religions have a taboo against economic interest?
Many religions historically developed prohibitions against charging interest primarily due to ethical concerns about economic exploitation.
Here&rsquo;s why this taboo emerged across different traditions:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Exploitative potential - Interest could trap vulnerable borrowers in cycles of debt, especially in ancient economies where loans were often for survival rather than investment.
The poor might borrow in emergencies and then face compounding debt they couldn&rsquo;t escape.</li>
<li>Biblical foundations - Judaism had restrictions in Deuteronomy and Exodus against charging interest to fellow Israelites (though permitted for foreigners).
Christianity adopted these principles, with passages like Luke 6:35 (&ldquo;lend, expecting nothing in return&rdquo;).</li>
<li>Islamic prohibition - The Quran explicitly forbids riba (interest/usury), viewing money as a medium of exchange rather than a commodity that should generate profit merely by being lent.</li>
<li>Natural purpose of money - Aristotle&rsquo;s influential view (which shaped Christian thought) held that money&rsquo;s purpose was exchange, not reproduction.
Interest made &ldquo;barren&rdquo; money unnaturally &ldquo;fertile.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Class and power dynamics - Religious authorities often sought to protect ordinary people from financial predation by wealthy elites who could manipulate interest rates.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Various traditions developed workarounds as commerce evolved.
Judaism created partnerships instead of loans, Islam developed profit-sharing arrangements, and Christianity gradually distinguished between &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; interest and exploitative usury.
The taboo has weakened in modern economic systems, though Islamic banking continues to operate on interest-free principles, and some Christian denominations maintain critiques of exploitative lending practices.

</p>

<p>
This book combines the field of economics &#x2013;especially monetary theory&#x2013; with other disciplines like ecology, physics, humanities, social sciences and development theory.
This transdisciplinary approach makes the book a unique contribution for researchers, students, policy makers and professionals working in governmental or nongovernmental institutions, as well as anyone interested in society&rsquo;s well-being and achieving a true social-ecological transformation.
It is written in an accessible language in order to reach a broad audience.
</p>

<p>
In 2015, more than 190 world leaders recognized that the world is on a &ldquo;collision course&rdquo; (Max-Neef) and committed to 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Many conferences and high-level meetings have been held since then, and one of the most frequently discussed topics is how to finance these goals.
There is a widespread belief that coming up with more money for sustainable development will &ldquo;do the trick&rdquo;.
Usually, the discussions focus on finding additional financial resources in order to achieve the goals faster.
In this book it is argued that not only is more money needed, but it needs to be a different kind of money.
The book demonstrates that ALL but one of the SDGs are directly linked to our monetary system, which &#x2013;being completely unnatural&#x2013; can be seen as the most important, but at the same time least recognized, reason for market failure.
Many people think we just need to do more, faster, better.
Very few say that we have done things fundamentally wrong and that the institutions and values which motivated us to do those things need to be changed.
It will be concluded that only if we change our unnatural design of money to a more natural one, will we be able to reach these goals

For advancing Silvio Gesell&rsquo;s ideas, it would be helpful if we had someone who made better translations of what Silvio Gesell wrote.
I think that many of the English translations are hard to understand.
However, there&rsquo;s also the question of how much did the translations could be improved and if Silvio Gesell had an archaic writing style that might pose a slight barrier to readability or reader comprehension, even in German and Spanish.
It would be helpful and maybe interesting to see if there are any bilingual German and English speakers or bilingual Spanish English speakers who could translate Silvio Gesell&rsquo;s works into English with a more clear writing style.
It may even be necessary for there to be a modernized edition of Silvio Gesell&rsquo;s works, similar to how there is a modernized edition of progress and poverty that cuts out all the fluff and many of the difficult clause structures that inhibit readability and reader comprehension that was released in 2005.
There is a 126 year gap between when progress and poverty was published and when the modernized version was published, and Silvio Gesell wrote his works back in the 1890s and maybe the 1900s, so there&rsquo;s still a 100 year gap that may make a modernized version more useful, especially if they include modern data, information, and arguments to supplement the original arguments better.
</p>

<p>
Reasons why Silvio Gesell is not as popular in the English-speaking world, or on the English-speaking Internet:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They&rsquo;re currently aren&rsquo;t very good resources for learning about Silvio Gesell.</li>
<li>The Wikipedia article, for example, is a very under developed and doesn&rsquo;t give a good overview of his ideas and what he proposed or why his ideas are great are so great.</li>
<li>Henry George was an American English speaking American and his most famous book sold millions of copies, so it&rsquo;s safe to say that the popularity of this book is one reason why his ideas have more attention than Silvio Gesell&rsquo;s ideas in modern times despite not as much attention as they used to.</li>
<li>There is a language barrier that makes it difficult for English speakers to know more about Silvio Gesell.</li>
<li>Silvio Gesell speak German and Spanish, so his bilingualism has given him somewhere attention and notability within these populations.</li>
<li>There are some translations of Silvio Gesell&rsquo;s works into English, but they aren&rsquo;t written very well and besides the Silvio Institute created by Josh Sidman, there aren&rsquo;t many other resources about for learning about Silvio Gesell and demurrage currency.</li>
<li>In the late 2010s and the early 2020s, there have been memes spreading college chapters created, blog, post, and other online movements that have been spreading attention about Henry George&rsquo;s works, but the same cannot be said for Silvio.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A quote from Keynes says that the interest rate on money plays a peculiar role in limiting the level of employment, since it sets a standard which the marginal efficiency of capital must reach if it is to be newly produced.
This is an extremely important concept and one that we need to examine in Greater detail in order to understand why Silvio Gesell considers interest a root cause of poverty, unemployment, and recurring economic crisis.

To help prove and make the point that Gesell made that all the things eventually lose value over time due to entropy.
List of things that lose value due to entropy, and how and why they lose value:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Food is probably the most obvious since it can spoil, rot, get moldy, etc.</li>
<li>Clothing can get ripped and worn out.</li>
<li>Newspapers and information which you can lose about value by going out a date and become less relevant to current events.</li>
<li>But I know the thing is that computer is kind of avoid the entropy stuff since they can make information, digital, unlike newspapers.
However, computers can still lose their value of time like hard drives are always stable, and things are probably a great time actually somehow, though it probably depends on the quality of the computer that you build or something.</li>
<li>Machinery in general just breaks down due to motions and forces in the universe and from normal war and terror.
Same with furniture.</li>
<li>Toothbrush bristles usually get dented overtime, so you have to have replacement eventually.</li>
<li>Or in general, any animal or plants are biological life in general will go the way of entropy.</li>
<li>Medical supplies like Band-Aids, condoms, toilet paper, etc.</li>
<li>Eventually, cement buildings are also more prone to entropy and other things.</li>

<h2 id="silvio-gesell"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Who was Silvio Gesell?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-silvio-gesell">
<p>
Silvio Gesell (1862-1930) was a German merchant, theoretical economist, and social reformer who developed unique ideas about monetary reform and land ownership.
His most significant contribution was the concept of &ldquo;Freigeld&rdquo; (free money) or &ldquo;stamp scrip&rdquo; - a form of currency that would automatically lose value over time.
</p>

<p>
Key aspects of Gesell&rsquo;s proposals included:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Depreciating Currency: He proposed a system where money would lose value at a fixed rate (typically 5-12% annually), requiring holders to pay a small fee or buy stamps periodically to maintain its nominal value. This concept is sometimes called &ldquo;demurrage.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Economic Theory:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>He believed that conventional money&rsquo;s ability to store value without depreciation gave it an unfair advantage over goods and services that naturally depreciate.</li>
<li>This led to hoarding and economic stagnation.</li>
<li>His depreciating currency would encourage circulation and investment rather than hoarding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Land Reform:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>He advocated for &ldquo;Freiland&rdquo; (free land) - the idea that land should belong to the community.</li>
<li>Proposed that land should be rented through a public bidding system.</li>
<li>Rent payments would go to the community, particularly to mothers and children.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
Gesell&rsquo;s ideas gained some attention during the Great Depression, with a few communities experimenting with stamp scrip currencies, most notably in Wörgl, Austria.
While these experiments showed some promise, they were generally short-lived.
</p>

<p>
His work influenced several economists, including John Maynard Keynes, who praised Gesell&rsquo;s insights in his &ldquo;General Theory&rdquo;.
Some modern economists see parallels between Gesell&rsquo;s ideas and negative interest rates or certain aspects of Modern Monetary Theory.
</p>

<p>
Today, while not mainstream, his ideas continue to influence alternative economic thinkers and some local currency movements.
His work has also gained renewed interest in discussions about digital currencies and unconventional monetary policy.

Money performs four main functions in today’s society.
It mainly serves as:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A medium of exchange</li>

Gesellians argue that the only reasonable function of money is to serve as a medium of exchange.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;Only money that goes out of date like a newspaper, rots like potatoes, rusts like iron, evaporates like ether, is capable of standing the test as an instrument for the exchange of potatoes, newspapers, iron and ether. For such money is not preferred to goods either by the purchaser or the seller. We then part with our goods for money only because we need the money as a means of exchange, not because we expect an advantage from possession of the money. So we must make money worse as a commodity if we wish to make it better as a medium of exchange.&rdquo;

<h2 id="inflation-difference"><span class="section-number-2">7.</span> How Is Demurrage Currency Different From Inflation?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-inflation-difference">
<p>
There are multiple differences between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_(currency)">demurage currency</a> and inflation.
The most important difference between demurrage and inflation is how they affect economic recessions differently:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Inflation is defined as &ldquo;a general rise in prices&rdquo;.</li>
<li>During recessions, prices tend to fall.</li>
<li>When prices fall and we can expect them to continue falling, commerce falls too. (because why would anyone buy something today when they will be able to buy it cheaper tomorrow?)</li>
<li>Recessions thus face a game theory problem: we want to increase commerce, but nobody wants to increase commerce if prices will continue to fall.</li>
<li>If prices are falling, then there is no inflation, by definition.</li>
<li>If there is no inflation, then there are no penalties for withholding money from circulation during a recession.</li>
<li>Thus, holders of money are rewarded for withholding their money from circulation during periods of falling prices. (because they are able to buy the same goods &amp; services at lower prices in the future.)</li>
<li>This makes it difficult to increase circulation and end the recession.</li>
<li>By contrast, demurrage currency would encourage people to keep commerce going during recessions, unlike inflation.</li>
</ol>

<p>
There are other differences as well:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Demurrage is consistent and predictable, whereas inflation is not.
For example, if the demurrage rate is, 6% annually, then money loses 1/2% of its purchasing power per month <i>every month</i>, regardless of whether the economy is expanding, contracting or remaining the same.
Inflation, on the other hand, is inconsistent and unpredictable.
Sometimes it is high, sometimes it is low, and sometimes it is negative (i.e. deflation).</li>
<li>Demurrage operates only on <i>outstanding units of currency</i>, not on newly issued money or money that will be issued in the future, whereas inflation affects both outstanding currency as well as money issued in the future.
So with demurrage, if a laborer earns a salary of $50,000 per year, that salary will buy the same quantity of goods &amp; services today, in one year, and in five years (assuming no inflation).
Whereas inflation affects the purchasing power of outstanding money as well as future money.
5% demurrage does not diminish what workers can buy with their future paychecks.
Whereas 5% inflation means that their future paychecks buy less and less as time goes by.</li>
<li>Inflation benefits borrowers at the expense of lenders, whereas demurrage does not.
The effect of demurrage on borrowers, on the other hand, depends on what they do with the money.
If they spend it (either for consumption or investment), they do not bear the cost of demurrage.
If they hold onto the money, then yes, they lose due to demurrage, but why would anyone borrow money just to hold onto it?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-no-reset" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="no-reset"><span class="section-number-2">8.</span> Which Is Better, Continuous Demurrage Or Resetting Demurrage?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-no-reset">
<p>
I&rsquo;ve never heard anyone propose demurrage that resets when it is exchanged.
Silvio Gesell never mentioned or proposed such a thing.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-time-preference" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="time-preference"><span class="section-number-2">9.</span> What is the relation between demurrage money and time preference?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-time-preference">
<p>
I am not sure what you mean, but it could be this:
</p>

<p>
Time preference means that people, on average, prefer to have a good or service sooner rather than later. In this way, time preference contributes to positive interest rates. On the other hand, the law of marginal utility counteracts time preference. If you have enough of everything you need, you prefer to have enough of everything you need in the future to have enough of everything now. If many people have enough of everything, or when there are a few extremely rich people, the law of marginal utility may overcome the time preference, and interest rates could be negative.
</p>

<p>
For example, when there is a choice between 10,000 loaves of bread now or one loaf of bread each day for the next 10,000 days, most people prefer one loaf of bread every day for the next 10,000 days. Most people will even prefer one loaf of bread each day for the next 1,000 days to 10,000 loaves of bread now, which implies a steep negative real interest rate. This is because bread spoils. No one can use 10,000 loaves of bread. It also applies to durable goods. Most people would prefer to have a new car now and a new car in ten years’ time instead of having two new cars now.
</p>

<p>

</p>



<p>
The time-preference theory of interest states that people prefer to consume sooner rather than later and therefore must be offered interest as a reward for postponing consumption. As another commenter observed, this is contradicted by many common sense examples.
</p>

<p>
My personal view is that people who subscribe to the time-preference theory have the causation backwards. It&rsquo;s not that interest exists because people prefer to consume sooner rather than later. It&rsquo;s that people behave AS IF they prefer to consume sooner rather than later because interest exists.
</p>

<p>
Consider the following example that I discussed in the Gesell course at the Henry George School. Imagine you run a lumber company. Let&rsquo;s think about how interest affects your incentives regarding when to cut down trees. Trees grow faster when they&rsquo;re young and more slowly as they get older. As soon as the growth rate of a tree falls below the interest rate, there is a financial incentive to cut the tree down. If you pay 7% interest on capital but you have a tree that is only growing at 5% per year, it is a bad financial decision not to cut it down. Note that the same logic applies even if you don&rsquo;t borrow money to finance you business, because interest also represents the opportunity cost of any productive investment. If you could be earning 7% by lending you money for interest, it is a bad financial decision to keep your wealth tied up in a tree that is only growing by 5% annually.
</p>

<p>
But what if the interest rate was 3%? Or 2%? Or 0%? How would that affect the incentives to cut down trees? At a zero interest rate, it would be reasonable to let a tree keep growing until it reaches the end of its growth cycle. At a 0% interest rate, a tree growing at 1% per year would still increase the owner&rsquo;s wealth. (This isn&rsquo;t to say that no one would ever cut down a tree that was still growing if interest fell to 0%, but in a zero-interest environment, non-neutral money would not create an artificial inventive to behave in a short-term focused way.)
</p>

<p>
So, to repeat, the argument from a Gesellian perspective is that time-preference is not an inherent part of human nature. It is a consequence of an irrational form of money that creates an artificial incentive structure that encourages short-term thinking.
</p>

<p>
A well-known Gesellian economist, Felix Fuders, makes the argument that our unnatural form of money is the main driver of unsustainable behavior and that the number one thing we should do to promote a more sustainable future is to institute a more natural form of money, as proposed by Silvio Gesell.
</p>

<p>
The example of harvesting trees was mean to explain how interest causes people to behave AS IF they have positive time preference. Consider the incentives facing a forestry company. Trees grow faster when they&rsquo;re young and slower as they get older. Let&rsquo;s say a tree grows at 10% a year for the first 10 years, 7% a year for the second 10 years, 5% a year for the third 10 years, 3% a year for the fourth 10 years, 1% a year for the fifth 10 years and then stops growing. In a world in which interest exists, it is a bad financial decision not to harvest trees that are growing at a rate below the interest rate. If the owner of a forestry company borrows money at 7% and has trees growing at 5%, that is a money losing proposition. He will be better off financially if he cuts the trees down, sells the lumber and pays off his debt. So the incentive is to cut down the trees once the rate of growth falls below the interest rate. Whereas if interest didn&rsquo;t exist and the forestry company could borrow money at zero interest, it would then be profitable to allow the tree to keep growing. Even at a 1% growth rate it would still be profitable to let the trees keep growing.
</p>

<p>
Interest is the opportunity cost of any productive investment. If holders of money can earn more by lending to the government, they will not choose to make their money available to productive enterprise. Therefore, in order to attract funding prospective productive enterprises need to offer projected returns in excess of the rate of interest. And those prospective investments which can&rsquo;t offer projected returns in excess of the rate of interest do not receive funding.
</p>

<p>
People who subscribe to the time-preference theory of interest say that interest needs to exist because people prefer to consume in the present versus in the future and that interest therefore needs to be offered to persuade them to postpone their consumption. Whereas my view is that the causality works the other way around. I don&rsquo;t believe humans generally prefer present consumption to future consumption. I believe they behave that way because of the influence of interest and that if interest didn&rsquo;t exist they would not behave that way. The forestry example is meant to illustrate this point. In a non-monetary economy, the owner of trees would reap profits from the growth of his trees as long as they keep growing, even if they only grow 1% per year. But when money is introduced into the equation, giving rise to interest, the incentives facing the owner of the trees changes, and it becomes a losing proposition to allow the trees to grow once their growth rate falls below the interest rate.

I don&rsquo;t think those monetary aggregates would continue to exist under a Gesellian system. The Ms describe a system in which most money is created by the private banking sector. A Gesellian currency would be issued by the government, so the systems for measuring money would have to be redefined. And the whole architecture of banking and financial intermediation would have to be reconceived from the ground up.
&gt; Probably that would be the case. But if so, wouldn&rsquo;t it be beneficial to conceive new Nanking architectures in advance? Did anybody delve into this?
Yes, it would certainly be worth thinking/writing about. I have had conversations about what banking would look like under a Gesellian system, but I&rsquo;m not aware of any writing specifically about that issue.

The one and only goal of monetary policy in a Gesellian system would be price stability.

Inflation is like a drug that needs to be administered in order to keep it circulating. But that drug is inconsistent, imprecise and has harmful side effects.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-interest-relation">

</p>


<p>
Silvio Gesell&rsquo;s theory of money and interest presents a unique perspective on interest, centered around his concept of &ldquo;free money&rdquo; (Freigeld). Here are the key aspects of Gesellian theory in relation to interest:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Natural Economic Order:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Gesell believed interest was not a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; phenomenon but an artificial construct</li>
<li>He argued money should &ldquo;rust&rdquo; like other commodities (lose value over time)</li>
<li>This concept led to his proposal for &ldquo;stamped money&rdquo; that depreciated at a fixed rate</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Critique of Traditional Interest:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Gesell argued traditional interest creates unfair advantages for money holders</li>
<li>He believed money&rsquo;s ability to be hoarded without loss created artificial scarcity</li>
<li>This hoarding power allows money owners to demand interest from productive enterprises</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Liquidity Premium:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Gesell recognized money has a natural advantage over goods due to its:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Durability</li>
<li>Portability</li>
<li>Universal acceptability</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This advantage creates a &ldquo;liquidity premium&rdquo; that holders can charge for parting with money</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Proposed Solution:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Demurrage: A holding fee/carrying cost on money</li>
<li>Regular stamps required to keep money valid</li>
<li>Encourages circulation rather than hoarding</li>
<li>Aims to eliminate the basic interest component</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Practical Applications:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Wörgl experiment in Austria (1932-1933) used Gesell&rsquo;s ideas</li>
<li>Various local currencies have incorporated demurrage features</li>
<li>Some modern digital currencies experiment with negative interest concepts</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>
Gesell&rsquo;s theories influenced later economists including John Maynard Keynes, who discussed them in his General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money.

<h2 id="planned-obsolescence"><span class="section-number-2">16.</span> Would Demurrage Currency Encourage Planned Obsolescence?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-planned-obsolescence">
<p>
I would make the opposite argument. Here&rsquo;s why. One of the most central concepts of the Gesellian perspective is that the existence of interest (which is a consequence of hoardable money) artificially limits the creation of productive capital. Since holders of excess money have the option to earn a risk-free return by lending to the government, this means prospective investments in newly formed capital will not receive funding unless they can provide projected returns significantly in excess of the risk-free interest rate. That means less companies get the investments they need to fund their operations, and as a result fewer companies exist than would be the case in a &ldquo;natural economy&rdquo; with demurrage money. So the replacement of conventional money by demurrage money would lead to a huge amount of new investment in productive capital, since people who currently hold trillions of dollars in unproductive government debt will need to look for other places to put their money. That would lead to increased competition among producers of goods &amp; services, resulting in higher quality and lower prices.
</p>

<p>
So, the short answer to your question is &#x2013; competition. Companies will have to make better products or they will lose customers. And demurrage money will lead to more competition and thus higher quality &amp; cheaper goods &amp; services.
</p>

<p>
Another thing this question overlooks is that the purpose of demurrage money is not to prevent people from saving wealth. It is to prevent them from using money as the vehicle for doing so. Saving wealth is still important and necessary. So how do you save wealth without saving money? Easy. Lend your money (but without interest). Instead of holding onto cash that loses value at 5% annually, lend your money to someone who has a current use for it. They then repay you the full principal of the loan in the future, and you have thereby avoided the erosion of purchasing power due to demurrage. In other words, you have saved.

<div id="outline-container-freigeld" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="freigeld"><span class="section-number-2">17.</span> What Is Freigeld?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-freigeld">
<p>
Freigeld has several special properties:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is maintained by a monetary authority to be spending-power stable (no inflation or deflation) by means of printing more money or withdrawing money from circulation.</li>
<li>It is cash flow safe (a scheme is put in place to ensure that the money is returned into the cash flow – for example, by demurrage – requiring stamps to be purchased and periodically attached to the money to keep it valid).</li>
<li>It is convertible into other currencies.</li>
<li>It is localized to a certain area (it is a local currency).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The name results from the idea that there is no incentive to store or hoard Freigeld as it will automatically lose its value after some time.
It is claimed that as a result, interest rates could decrease to zero.

<div id="outline-container-free-money-backing" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="free-money-backing"><span class="section-number-2">18.</span> Would free money need to be backed?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-free-money-backing">
<p>
Gesellian money would not need backing. He stated that clearly in his book. Backing is primarily meant to enhance money&rsquo;s properties as a store of value. But the whole idea of Gesellian money is to make it unsuitable for use as a store of value. In that sense, backing is counterproductive. In Gesell&rsquo;s view, the primary cause of inflation is the unstable and unpredictable velocity of money. Demurrage is meant to solve that problem by incentivizing the steady circulation of money under all economic conditions. If velocity is stable, maintaining a stable price level becomes much easier. The reason monetary policy is so difficult with our current form of money is because of unstable monetary velocity. This is where the term &ldquo;pushing on a string&rdquo; comes from. It refers to a situation like after the 2008 crisis in which the world&rsquo;s central banks created massive amounts of new monetary reserves but were powerless to make those reserves circulate. Regulating the price level via adjustments in the money supply with unstable velocity is extremely difficult and imprecise.
</p>


<p>
From a Gesellian perspective, free money (Freigeld) would not need to be backed by commodities like gold or silver. Here&rsquo;s why:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Purpose of Freigeld:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Functions as pure medium of exchange</li>
<li>Designed to circulate, not store value</li>
<li>Value maintained through controlled supply, not backing</li>
<li>Emphasis on velocity rather than intrinsic worth</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Gesell&rsquo;s Reasoning:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Backing creates the same hoarding problems as traditional money</li>
<li>Physical backing would defeat the purpose of demurrage</li>
<li>Money&rsquo;s value should come from its utility in exchange</li>
<li>Natural economic forces would regulate its value</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Practical Considerations:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Value maintained through:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Controlled issuance by monetary authority</li>
<li>Mandatory circulation via demurrage</li>
<li>Regular economic activity</li>
<li>Limited supply relative to goods/services</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<li>Modern Parallels:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most modern fiat currencies aren&rsquo;t commodity-backed</li>
<li>Value maintained through fiscal/monetary policy</li>
<li>Similar principle to Gesell&rsquo;s proposals</li>
<li>Trust and utility create value, not physical backing</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Potential Advantages:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Greater flexibility in monetary policy</li>
<li>Reduced risk of deflation</li>
<li>Lower administrative costs</li>
<li>Simpler implementation of demurrage</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>
The key is that Freigeld derives its value from its function as a medium of exchange rather than from any backing asset.

<h2 id="free-money-regional"><span class="section-number-2">19.</span> Would free money be applied only regionally?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-free-money-regional">
<p>
Gesell intended demurrage money to be implemented at a national and international level. Personally, while I think his proposal is sound, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine mobilizing the political will in today&rsquo;s world to get an entire country to change to a new form of money. That&rsquo;s why many modern Gesellians have chosen to focus on local and alternative currencies. Its much easier to envision a realistic path forward implementing demurrage on a local/community level, but I consider that an intermediate step on the way toward global adoption. If its viability can be proven on a local level, that can help mobilize support for adoption on a larger scale. But, to repeat, Gesell never discussed local/alternative currencies. He was focused exclusively on national and international adoption.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="org4064e3f">
<p>
What will ensure the value of the money is trust? In Wörgl, didn&rsquo;t the mayor use 40,000 schillings as backing for the demurrage currency he implemented?
</p>

</div>
<p>
As Gesell said, there is no need for backing to &ldquo;ensure the value&rdquo; of money. The fact that money is the essential precondition for the functioning of the division of labor is all the &ldquo;backing&rdquo; money needs.
</p>

<p>
Yes, in Wörgl they deposited 40,000 schillings in the bank as &ldquo;backing&rdquo;. Worgl happened after Gesell died, but I&rsquo;m quite sure he would have said the backing was completely unnecessary.
</p>
