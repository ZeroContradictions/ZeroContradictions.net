<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-demurrage">
<p>
Money performs four main functions in today’s society.
It mainly serves as:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A medium of exchange</li>
<li>A standard of deferred payment</li>
<li>A store of wealth</li>
<li>A unit of account / measurement</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
Gesellians argue that the only reasonable function of money is to serve as a medium of exchange.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;Only money that goes out of date like a newspaper, rots like potatoes, rusts like iron, evaporates like ether, is capable of standing the test as an instrument for the exchange of potatoes, newspapers, iron and ether. For such money is not preferred to goods either by the purchaser or the seller. We then part with our goods for money only because we need the money as a means of exchange, not because we expect an advantage from possession of the money. So we must make money worse as a commodity if we wish to make it better as a medium of exchange.&rdquo;

<h2 id="inflation-difference"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> How Is Demurrage Currency Different From Inflation?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-inflation-difference">
<p>
There are multiple differences between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_(currency)">demurage currency</a> and inflation.
</p>

<p>
The most important difference between demurrage and inflation is how they affect economic recessions differently:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Inflation is defined as &ldquo;a general rise in prices&rdquo;.</li>
<li>During recessions, prices tend to fall.</li>
<li>When prices fall and we can expect them to continue falling, commerce falls too. (because why would anyone buy something today when they will be able to buy it cheaper tomorrow?)</li>
<li>Recessions thus face a game theory problem: we want to increase commerce, but nobody wants to increase commerce if prices will continue to fall.</li>
<li>If prices are falling, then there is no inflation, by definition.</li>
<li>If there is no inflation, then there are no penalties for withholding money from circulation during a recession.</li>
<li>Thus, holders of money are rewarded for withholding their money from circulation during periods of falling prices. (because they are able to buy the same goods &amp; services at lower prices in the future.)</li>
<li>This makes it difficult to increase circulation and end the recession.</li>
<li>By contrast, demurrage currency would encourage people to keep commerce going during recessions, unlike inflation.</li>
</ol>

<p>
There are other differences as well:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Demurrage is consistent and predictable, whereas inflation is not.
For example, if the demurrage rate is, 6% annually, then money loses 1/2% of its purchasing power per month <i>every month</i>, regardless of whether the economy is expanding, contracting or remaining the same.
Inflation, on the other hand, is inconsistent and unpredictable.
Sometimes it is high, sometimes it is low, and sometimes it is negative (i.e. deflation).</li>
<li>Demurrage operates only on <i>outstanding units of currency</i>, not on newly issued money or money that will be issued in the future, whereas inflation affects both outstanding currency as well as money issued in the future.
So with demurrage, if a laborer earns a salary of $50,000 per year, that salary will buy the same quantity of goods &amp; services today, in one year, and in five years (assuming no inflation).
Whereas inflation affects the purchasing power of outstanding money as well as future money.
5% demurrage does not diminish what workers can buy with their future paychecks.
Whereas 5% inflation means that their future paychecks buy less and less as time goes by.</li>
<li>Inflation benefits borrowers at the expense of lenders, whereas demurrage does not.
The effect of demurrage on borrowers, on the other hand, depends on what they do with the money.
If they spend it (either for consumption or investment), they do not bear the cost of demurrage.
If they hold onto the money, then yes, they lose due to demurrage, but why would anyone borrow money just to hold onto it?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-time-preference" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="time-preference"><span class="section-number-2">6.</span> What is the relation between demurrage money and time preference?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-time-preference">
<p>
I am not sure what you mean, but it could be this:
</p>

<p>
Time preference means that people, on average, prefer to have a good or service sooner rather than later. In this way, time preference contributes to positive interest rates. On the other hand, the law of marginal utility counteracts time preference. If you have enough of everything you need, you prefer to have enough of everything you need in the future to have enough of everything now. If many people have enough of everything, or when there are a few extremely rich people, the law of marginal utility may overcome the time preference, and interest rates could be negative.
</p>

<p>
For example, when there is a choice between 10,000 loaves of bread now or one loaf of bread each day for the next 10,000 days, most people prefer one loaf of bread every day for the next 10,000 days. Most people will even prefer one loaf of bread each day for the next 1,000 days to 10,000 loaves of bread now, which implies a steep negative real interest rate. This is because bread spoils. No one can use 10,000 loaves of bread. It also applies to durable goods. Most people would prefer to have a new car now and a new car in ten years’ time instead of having two new cars now.
</p>

<p>

</p>



<p>
The time-preference theory of interest states that people prefer to consume sooner rather than later and therefore must be offered interest as a reward for postponing consumption. As another commenter observed, this is contradicted by many common sense examples.
</p>

<p>
My personal view is that people who subscribe to the time-preference theory have the causation backwards. It&rsquo;s not that interest exists because people prefer to consume sooner rather than later. It&rsquo;s that people behave AS IF they prefer to consume sooner rather than later because interest exists.
</p>

<p>
Consider the following example that I discussed in the Gesell course at the Henry George School. Imagine you run a lumber company. Let&rsquo;s think about how interest affects your incentives regarding when to cut down trees. Trees grow faster when they&rsquo;re young and more slowly as they get older. As soon as the growth rate of a tree falls below the interest rate, there is a financial incentive to cut the tree down. If you pay 7% interest on capital but you have a tree that is only growing at 5% per year, it is a bad financial decision not to cut it down. Note that the same logic applies even if you don&rsquo;t borrow money to finance you business, because interest also represents the opportunity cost of any productive investment. If you could be earning 7% by lending you money for interest, it is a bad financial decision to keep your wealth tied up in a tree that is only growing by 5% annually.
</p>

<p>
But what if the interest rate was 3%? Or 2%? Or 0%? How would that affect the incentives to cut down trees? At a zero interest rate, it would be reasonable to let a tree keep growing until it reaches the end of its growth cycle. At a 0% interest rate, a tree growing at 1% per year would still increase the owner&rsquo;s wealth. (This isn&rsquo;t to say that no one would ever cut down a tree that was still growing if interest fell to 0%, but in a zero-interest environment, non-neutral money would not create an artificial inventive to behave in a short-term focused way.)
</p>

<p>
So, to repeat, the argument from a Gesellian perspective is that time-preference is not an inherent part of human nature. It is a consequence of an irrational form of money that creates an artificial incentive structure that encourages short-term thinking.
</p>

<p>
A well-known Gesellian economist, Felix Fuders, makes the argument that our unnatural form of money is the main driver of unsustainable behavior and that the number one thing we should do to promote a more sustainable future is to institute a more natural form of money, as proposed by Silvio Gesell.

<h2 id="monetary-levels"><span class="section-number-2">7.</span> At which monetary level would demurrage take effect? M0, M1, M2, M3?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-monetary-levels">
<p>
I don&rsquo;t think those monetary aggregates would continue to exist under a Gesellian system. The Ms describe a system in which most money is created by the private banking sector. A Gesellian currency would be issued by the government, so the systems for measuring money would have to be redefined. And the whole architecture of banking and financial intermediation would have to be reconceived from the ground up.
&gt; Probably that would be the case. But if so, wouldn&rsquo;t it be beneficial to conceive new Nanking architectures in advance? Did anybody delve into this?
Yes, it would certainly be worth thinking/writing about. I have had conversations about what banking would look like under a Gesellian system, but I&rsquo;m not aware of any writing specifically about that issue.

<h2 id="inflation-target"><span class="section-number-2">8.</span> What should the inflation target be?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-inflation-target">
<p>
It should be 0%.
The one and only goal of monetary policy in a Gesellian system would be price stability. So-called &ldquo;good inflation&rdquo; of 2-3% in our current system is a symptom of an irrational form of money that doesn&rsquo;t circulate properly. Inflation is like a drug that needs to be administered in order to keep it circulating. But that drug is inconsistent, imprecise and has harmful side effects.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-planned-obsolescence">
<p>
I would make the opposite argument. Here&rsquo;s why. One of the most central concepts of the Gesellian perspective is that the existence of interest (which is a consequence of hoardable money) artificially limits the creation of productive capital. Since holders of excess money have the option to earn a risk-free return by lending to the government, this means prospective investments in newly formed capital will not receive funding unless they can provide projected returns significantly in excess of the risk-free interest rate. That means less companies get the investments they need to fund their operations, and as a result fewer companies exist than would be the case in a &ldquo;natural economy&rdquo; with demurrage money. So the replacement of conventional money by demurrage money would lead to a huge amount of new investment in productive capital, since people who currently hold trillions of dollars in unproductive government debt will need to look for other places to put their money. That would lead to increased competition among producers of goods &amp; services, resulting in higher quality and lower prices.
</p>

<p>
So, the short answer to your question is &#x2013; competition. Companies will have to make better products or they will lose customers. And demurrage money will lead to more competition and thus higher quality &amp; cheaper goods &amp; services.
</p>

<p>
Another thing this question overlooks is that the purpose of demurrage money is not to prevent people from saving wealth. It is to prevent them from using money as the vehicle for doing so. Saving wealth is still important and necessary. So how do you save wealth without saving money? Easy. Lend your money (but without interest). Instead of holding onto cash that loses value at 5% annually, lend your money to someone who has a current use for it. They then repay you the full principal of the loan in the future, and you have thereby avoided the erosion of purchasing power due to demurrage. In other words, you have saved.

<div id="outline-container-freigeld" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="freigeld"><span class="section-number-2">13.</span> What Is Freigeld?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-freigeld">
<p>
Freigeld has several special properties:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is maintained by a monetary authority to be spending-power stable (no inflation or deflation) by means of printing more money or withdrawing money from circulation.</li>
<li>It is cash flow safe (a scheme is put in place to ensure that the money is returned into the cash flow – for example, by demurrage – requiring stamps to be purchased and periodically attached to the money to keep it valid).</li>
<li>It is convertible into other currencies.</li>
<li>It is localized to a certain area (it is a local currency).</li>
</ul>
<p>
The name results from the idea that there is no incentive to store or hoard Freigeld as it will automatically lose its value after some time.
It is claimed that as a result, interest rates could decrease to zero.

<div id="outline-container-free-money-backing" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="free-money-backing"><span class="section-number-2">14.</span> Would free money need to be backed?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-free-money-backing">
<p>
Gesellian money would not need backing. He stated that clearly in his book. Backing is primarily meant to enhance money&rsquo;s properties as a store of value. But the whole idea of Gesellian money is to make it unsuitable for use as a store of value. In that sense, backing is counterproductive. In Gesell&rsquo;s view, the primary cause of inflation is the unstable and unpredictable velocity of money. Demurrage is meant to solve that problem by incentivizing the steady circulation of money under all economic conditions. If velocity is stable, maintaining a stable price level becomes much easier. The reason monetary policy is so difficult with our current form of money is because of unstable monetary velocity. This is where the term &ldquo;pushing on a string&rdquo; comes from. It refers to a situation like after the 2008 crisis in which the world&rsquo;s central banks created massive amounts of new monetary reserves but were powerless to make those reserves circulate. Regulating the price level via adjustments in the money supply with unstable velocity is extremely difficult and imprecise.

<h2 id="free-money-regional"><span class="section-number-2">15.</span> Would free money be applied only regionally?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-free-money-regional">
<p>
Gesell intended demurrage money to be implemented at a national and international level. Personally, while I think his proposal is sound, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine mobilizing the political will in today&rsquo;s world to get an entire country to change to a new form of money. That&rsquo;s why many modern Gesellians have chosen to focus on local and alternative currencies. Its much easier to envision a realistic path forward implementing demurrage on a local/community level, but I consider that an intermediate step on the way toward global adoption. If its viability can be proven on a local level, that can help mobilize support for adoption on a larger scale. But, to repeat, Gesell never discussed local/alternative currencies. He was focused exclusively on national and international adoption.

<div class="opponent" id="org9ae02bc">
<p>
What will ensure the value of the money is trust? In Wörgl, didn&rsquo;t the mayor use 40,000 schillings as backing for the demurrage currency he implemented?
</p>

</div>
<p>
As Gesell said, there is no need for backing to &ldquo;ensure the value&rdquo; of money. The fact that money is the essential precondition for the functioning of the division of labor is all the &ldquo;backing&rdquo; money needs.
</p>

<p>
Yes, in Wörgl they deposited 40,000 schillings in the bank as &ldquo;backing&rdquo;. Worgl happened after Gesell died, but I&rsquo;m quite sure he would have said the backing was completely unnecessary.
