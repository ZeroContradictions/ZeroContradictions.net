<h2 id="what-is-race"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> What Is Race? What Is Race Realism?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what-is-race">
<p>
<b>Race Realism</b> is a subcategory of <a href="https://odysee.com/@BlitheringGenius:2/BiologicalRealism:b">Biological Realism</a>. Being a race realist means acknowledging that:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Race is a method of categorizing humans that emerges based on phenotypic similarities, and largely corresponds to human genetic clustering and ancestry.</li>
<li>Many genetic variants occur at different frequencies in each race for various reasons, including but not limited to: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_pressure">selective pressures</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_drift">genetic drift</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect">founder effects</a>.</li>
<li>Race is a categorization scheme for human beings based on phenotypic similarity. Racial categories are useful because they tend to have predictive and explanatory power, <a href="#averages-and-exceptions">barring exceptions</a>.</li>
<li>A race is a descriptive category of things, not a subject (more on that below).</li>
</ol>
<p>
That&rsquo;s it. But you have to understand what a &ldquo;statistical cluster&rdquo; is and what that means with regards to race and genetics, and that racial differences are often continuous.
Race realism is a rational inquiry into the nature of race. <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#not-racists">Race Realism ≠ Racism</a>.
</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>
A race is a descriptive category of things.
Just because I can assign people into descriptive categories, it does not follow that those categories will interact with the world as units. In general, they won&rsquo;t.
It would be very difficult to act on Europeans as a class, just as it would be very difficult to act on all left-handed men over 6 feet tall. Neither class meets the criteria for an object.
A rock is an object that can be acted upon as a unit. It has internal coherence by its nature.
A race is not an object; it has no internal coherence.
</p>

<p>
Likewise a race is not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_and_object_(philosophy)">subject</a>. It has no will or awareness. It does not act in the world.
The white race doesn&rsquo;t have agency any more than the set of all left-handed men over 6 feet tall has agency.
Both are merely descriptive categories to which individuals can be assigned.
That&rsquo;s why it is stupid to blame whites as a class for such things as slavery and colonialism.
White people never did anything as a unit.
There were various individuals and social groups doing various things, the net result of which included such outcomes as slavery, colonialism and the expansion of European populations into the Western Hemisphere.

<p>
It&rsquo;s not clear what people mean when they claim that &ldquo;race is a social construct&rdquo;.
Do they mean that the concept of race is socially influenced, and thus suspect?
Or do they mean that races are purely social categories, with no relation to objective reality?
If they have no relation to objective reality, then how do we recognize instances of them?
A charitable interpretation is that there is a biological basis for the categories, and the discrete nature of these categories is imposed on a more complex reality.

<hr>

<p>
We can break down the argument that &ldquo;race is not real&rdquo; as follows:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There are social stereotypes around race.</li>
<li>That makes them a social construct.</li>
<li>Social constructs are things we invented.</li>
<li>Since we invented them, we can change them at will.</li>
<li>Thus, reality doesn&rsquo;t really exist.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note that this argument never makes any references to human biology (which form the basis of race in the first place), or studies of how races are different from each other.
This argument is also used for arguing that <a href="../civilization/social-justice#thoughts-on-transgender-people">gender is a social construct that doesn&rsquo;t have any biological implications</a>.
</p>

<p>
Regardless, if race is a &ldquo;social construct&rdquo;, then that begs the question why racial diversity is important.
If races don&rsquo;t exist at all, then that begs the question why racism exists at all.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
Framing race as a social construct ignores that race is a statistical cluster of genes.
<a href="#race-is-biological-examples">There are countless examples showing that race <i>does</i> have a clear biological basis</a>.
While clusters <i>can</i> be arbitrary, there&rsquo;s also reasonable mathematical methods for categorizing human populations into different racial groups via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis">Cluster Analysis</a>, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">Principal Component Analysis</a> and <a href="#K-cluster-analysis"><i>k</i>-Means Clustering</a>.
This works at the level of continental groups or even ethnic groups within a continent (or even groups within an ethnicity).
At times the progression is smooth, with each group gradually giving way to the next, and at other times, the transition is abrupt.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-continuum-cline-fallacy">
<p>
At least two fallacies are made in this argument, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox#Continuum_fallacy">Continuum Fallacy</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
X and Y are two extremes on a spectrum. There is no clear point at which X becomes Y, therefore, X and Y do not exist.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If races don&rsquo;t exist because they exist on a continuum, then colors don&rsquo;t exist either because colors also exist on a continuum.
But it&rsquo;s clearly useful to distinguish colors by name, so this is a contradiction.
</p>

<p>
Race denialists also use words like &ldquo;White people&rdquo;, &ldquo;Black people&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Asians&rdquo; to refer to people and talk about <a href="#environmental-factors">racial disparities</a>, so they implicitly believe that people <i>can</i> be categorized into different races.
It&rsquo;s thus hypocritical of them to insist that race doesn&rsquo;t exist just because it&rsquo;s on a continuum.
Using words to refer to races or specific colors while continuing to deny that they exist is <a href="../epistemology/reasoning-skills#tactical-nihilism">tactical nihilism</a>.
</p>

<p>
Genetic analysis can separate humanity into <a href="#taxa-classification">reasonably distinct taxons</a>.
There are multiple different racial taxonomies, and they each vary depending on the context and how the threshold parameters for dividing taxons are set.
Hence, racial groups can be lumped into vast continental-scale agglomerations or split as finely as you like.
For example, Siberians could considered a separate race in one taxonomy model, while being considered a subset of East Asians in another model.
Every system of categorization runs into disputes between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumpers_and_splitters">&ldquo;lumpers&rdquo; and &ldquo;splitters&rdquo;</a>.
Whether lumping or splitting is more appropriate depends on the situation.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Subspecies or races are not branches on a tree, although sometimes they are depicted that way for convenience.
They are more like waves on a choppy sea.
The bumpy surface represents the distribution of genetic variants.
Each bump is a cluster of similar individuals &#x2013; a race &#x2013; but the area between those waves is not empty.
There are intermediate forms, genes flow between the bumps, and the bumps change over time.
This metaphor is called &ldquo;adaptive topography&rdquo;.

<p>
Even if the distribution of human groups is continuous with no distinct genetic or phenotypic breaks (and it often is), that wouldn&rsquo;t render each group along the distribution non-existent, nor would it render the differences between each group insignificant.
That would be tantamount to saying yellow is equivalent to orange.
Sometimes <a href="../images/races-overlap-with-geographical-regions.gif">racial groups are even separated by geographic landmarks</a>, such as deserts and mountains, which enable us to clearly identify definitive regions and groups.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
The genetic definitions of various races are defined by clusters of multiple characteristics.
So, rejecting the validity of defining racial categories also requires rejecting <a href="../epistemology/axiology#g-factors-and-s-factors">the validity of all the other general variables in this list</a> since their validity is justified by similar logic, lest there be contradicting beliefs.
Most people wouldn&rsquo;t reject those variables though, which suggests that it&rsquo;s valid to define racial categories since they have predictive and explanatory power.
</p>

<hr>
<div class="opponent" id="org1dfaf77">
<p>
But clines are a better way to describe human genetic diversity than races.
</p>

</div>
<p>
A cline is defined as a gradation in one measurable physical or genetic characteristic, within or between biological groups.
Some race-denialists try to replace the word &rsquo;race&rsquo; with &rsquo;cline&rsquo;, but this doesn&rsquo;t clarify anything.
The stress on the &ldquo;clinial&rdquo; nature of human population and genetic distribution is just motivated obfuscation, as is much of the discussion on inherited human differences.
</p>

<p>
If the word &ldquo;cline&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t abused to deny the validity of racial categories (and biological differences by extension), it could potentially be a useful term, similar to how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect_continuum">dialect continuum</a> can be a useful term in linguistics for emphasizing gradual variations across geographical distances.
Races are to languages as clines are to dialect continuums.
But even then, linguists still find it useful to divide dialect continuums into zones or subdivisions (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guthrie_classification_of_Bantu_languages">the Guthrie classification of Bantu languages</a>).
So even when we replace the word &ldquo;language&rdquo; with &ldquo;dialect continuum&rdquo;, we still kind of end up back where we started in order to talk about the linguistic differences across the dialect continuum.
The same goes for &ldquo;race&rdquo; versus &ldquo;cline&rdquo;.
Most linguists wouldn&rsquo;t have any problems with dividing a dialect continuum up into zones to understand it better.
They might debate where the exact boundaries of the zones are, but that&rsquo;s about it.
This highlights their hypocrisy when they take issue with defining racial categories, which also exist on a continuum.

<h3 id="race-has-predictive-power"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> Why is it practical to classify humans based on race, instead of traits?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-race-has-predictive-power">
<p>
RatWiki has stated the following question in their fallacious and bad-faith <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Racialism#Alternate_classifications">&ldquo;Racialism&rdquo; article</a>:
</p>
<div class="opponent" id="org504b916">
<p>
Why stop with simplistic appearance-based racial classifications?
Why not racially classify humans based on other genetic traits that are just as geographically dispersed as skin color?
</p>

</div>
<p>
Almost nobody classifies humans mainly based on traits, rather than race.
That&rsquo;s true whether someone is a race realist, a race denialist, or simply doesn&rsquo;t care.
When people talk about groups of people based on their genetics, their appearance, and/or their ancestry, it is very common and very accepted to describe and refer to people based on their <i><a href="#what-is-race">race</a></i>.
In practice, the people who ask these kinds of questions still tend to talk about races as a way to refer to groups of peoples (e.g. complaining about how white people have more money than black people).
So if it&rsquo;s implicit that it&rsquo;s okay for race denialists to talk about race, but not okay for race realists to talk about race, then this is <a href="../epistemology/reasoning-skills#tactical-nihilism">tactical nihilism</a> and it&rsquo;s a bad-faith question.
</p>

<p>
More to the point, the answer is that classifying humans based on traits has less predictive power than classifying humans based on race.
<a href="#what-is-race">As stated before</a>, the definition of <i>race</i> is &ldquo;a statistical cluster of genetic variation characterized by phenotypic similarity and shared ancestry&rdquo;.
Hence, if we know a person&rsquo;s race, but not their individual traits, then we can make predictions about a high number of their traits, and the predictions will have a high tendency to be correct.
<a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#IQ-scores">The same goes for IQ scores</a>.
</p>

<p>
Obviously though, the best method for classifying humans depends on the context.
If you can judge a person based on their personal traits than their racial background, that&rsquo;s always more preferable.
For example, medical diagnoses and treatment should always be conducted on an individual-by-individual basis.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, the main reason why it&rsquo;s so taboo to acknowledge these facts is that <a href="#environmental-factors">it would strengthen the argument that most racial disparities are caused by genetic</a>, rather than environmental factors.
The argument that we can classify humans based on traits instead of race is a <a href="../epistemology/reasoning-skills#tactical-nihilism">tactical nihilism</a> argument.
It&rsquo;s not intended to be good-faith.
The real intent of making such an argument is to hide the reality that some people (and some races) are naturally destined to <a href="#intelligence-inheritability">be smarter</a>, to <a href="#race-gap-crime-rates">commit more crimes</a>, etc than others, due to their genetics.

<p>
Whether or not human races can be classified as separate subspecies depends on the chosen taxonomy and the criteria for racial/taxonomic classification.
Race realists generally contend that human races are different enough to be categorized into separate subspecies, while race denialists contend that races are too similar to be considered different subspecies.
The former position is more coherent than the latter, but this isn&rsquo;t very important.
The bottom line is that human races are different from each other to have their own names as well as noticeable and distinguishable physiological features.

</div>
<p>
This is tactical nihilism.
Races are so different from each other that setting a parameter to the right level would classify entire groups of millions of people into distinct taxa.
Every algorithm for classifying taxa and taxonomy has to have parameters plugged into it.
In particular, the threshold parameter is important for determining whether two groups are classified as different taxa or not.
In essence, this means that anybody can come up with whatever algorithm they want for classifying races as distinct taxa, or not.
</p>


<p>
Regardless, if you tell a clustering algorithm to group people based on genetic data (and the threshold parameter for separating humans into distinct groups is set to the right level), you will get the socially defined races with practically perfect accuracy.
In one example, a genetic cluster analysis of 3636 people grouped people into 4 categories who identified as white, Asian, black, or Hispanic.
Only 5 of those people fit into a category different to that of their self-identified race (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15625622/">Tang, 2004</a>).
The algorithm GRAF-pop is able to predict individual ancestry with high accuracy (<a href="https://sci-hubtw.hkvisa.net/10.1534/g3.118.200925">Yumi, 2019</a>).

<p>
The existence of an &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; number of clusters is not required for there to be validity to the structure we find in the clusters.
When one chooses n+1 clusters instead of choosing n clusters, the effect is splitting a cluster rather than reshuffling all the clusters.
Then what you usually see is individuals staying in their current cluster and also being assigned to a sub-cluster.
There isn&rsquo;t any &ldquo;moving from one cluster to another cluster&rdquo;, except perhaps some fuzziness on the edges, which does not destroy the validity of the concept.
If you look closely at <a href="https://theuntangler.files.wordpress.com/2022/04/241123.pdf">this chart showing the genetic similarities and differences of modern humans</a>, what we find is that:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When K=1, the cluster is all of humanity.</li>
<li>When K=2, the clusters are Sub-Saharan Africans (which are still in the &ldquo;humanity&rdquo; cluster) and Non-Sub-Saharan Africans (which are still in the &ldquo;humanity&rdquo; cluster).</li>
<li>When K=3, the clusters are Sub-Saharan Africans, West Eurasians (which are still in the &ldquo;Non-Sub-Saharan African cluster) and East-Eurasian+Amerindians (which are still in the &rdquo;Non-Sub-Saharan African&ldquo; cluster)</li>
<li>When K=4, the clusters roughly correspond to Sub-Saharan Africans, West Eurasians, East Eurasians (which are still in the East-Eurasian+Amerindians cluster) and Amerindians (which are still in the East-Eurasian+Amerindians cluster)</li>
<li>When K=5, the clusters roughly correspond to Khoisan (which are still in the Sub-Saharan African cluster), non-Khoisan Sub-Saharan-Africans (which are still in the Sub-Saharan African cluster), West Eurasians, East Eurasians, and Amerindians.</li>
<li>When K=6, the South Eurasian cluster splits from East Asians. This ancestry is found at high levels in Oceania and South India, and low levels throughout East and Southeast Asia.</li>
<li>When K=7, Siberians appear as a separate group, distinct from East Asians. Even at this level of analysis, Siberia is relatively heterogeneous. The vast region is accessible to a diverse range of racial and ethnic groups and historical migrations. As a result, the Siberian population carries East Asian, West Eurasian, and Amerindian ancestry.</li>
<li>When K=8, South Asians appear as a distinct group. Ancestry components previously classified as West Eurasian and South Eurasian (blue and purple) are now almost entirely South Asian (green). This green component most likely represents a prehistoric population descended from both West and South Eurasian peoples.</li>
<li>When K=9, the West Eurasian splits into European and West Asian. The latter is labeled as such (rather than the usual Middle-Eastern-North-African) because this ancestry component likely originated in West Asia before spreading to North Africa via an ‘into Africa&rsquo; return migration.</li>

The polymorphism is found at varying but significant levels in many parts of the world, but is almost totally absent from East Asia. Interestingly, alleles derived from the 7R allele are fairly common in China, even though the 7R alleles themselves are extremely rare there.

With so many examples showing how different human populations evolved different physical and internal adaptations to become more physically fit in their environments, how could anyone reasonably deny that different populations didn&rsquo;t also evolve to have different mental and behavioral traits?

<a href="https://thuletide.wordpress.com/2020/12/30/mythbusting-is-race-only-skin-deep/">Race matters in transplant surgeries</a>.
Simply put, you can&rsquo;t mix-and-match body parts from different races.
If you put a white organ in a black body, it will almost certainly be rejected, and vise versa.
To successfully transplant an organ onto or into another person, the donor needs to be a genetic match, i.e. of the same race.
As a result, mixed-race people have an incredibly difficult time finding suitable transplant donors.
</p>

<p>
Every race denialist says that race is not real (i.e. race is not biological) until someone needs an organ transplant.
But don&rsquo;t take my word for it, listen to the medical professionals.

<h2 id="why-race-realism-matters"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Why Does It Matter That People Accept That Race Is Biological?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why-race-realism-matters">
<p>
Because race realism is <a href="#environmental-factors">the best scientific explanation</a> for differences in crime rates, academic achievement, and success between different races in the modern world.
If we completely rule out the best explanation, deny the influence of biology on human outcomes, and make it evil to challenge the Left&rsquo;s denial of biology, then the Left has free reign to come up with all sorts of insane, ridiculous, and racist anti-white conspiracy theories and explanations to account for the achievement gaps between races.
These mistaken beliefs motivate the Left to pursue &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; to the achievement gaps that involve dismantling meritocracy and thwarting criminal justice at every opportunity with extreme zeal and steady progress.
This is really bad if civilization is to have a decent future.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if people can be convinced that racial outcome gaps are caused by genetic differences instead of environment factors, then people will stop believing in hidden forces and conspiracies.
The result is that meritocracy and criminal justice will be preserved, instead of being dismantled in the name of &ldquo;racial equality&rdquo;.
If we want to preserve civilization, then we need millions of people to come to terms with biological realism.
It&rsquo;s the truth.

<p>
TL;DR: Accepting race realism eliminates the justification for many of the detrimental social policies in the West, including &ldquo;<a href="#anti-white-ideology-in-west">anti-racism</a>&rdquo;, <a href="../civilization/social-justice#demographic-quotas">demographic quotas</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6nG7RloYf0">mass immigration</a>, etc.

<p>
This is essentially a (fallacious) <a href="../epistemology/reasoning-skills#pascals-mugging">Pascal&rsquo;s Mugging Argument</a>.
It assumes that society won&rsquo;t be rational enough to fully understand the implications of biology, statistics, and probabilistic inference.
To argue that race isn&rsquo;t real is to also reinforce the assumption that <a href="#environmental-factors">racial achievement gaps</a> are completely environmental and must be caused by some sort of historical &ldquo;social injustice&rdquo;, which leads to support for &ldquo;Critical Race Theory&rdquo;, <a href="../civilization/social-justice#demographic-quotas">demographic quotas</a>, and <a href="#anti-white-ideology-in-west">anti-white</a> and anti-Asian racism in order to make up for those gaps.
We don&rsquo;t see how that&rsquo;s any better.
If it is indeed the case that different races are genetically predisposed to have different behaviors, then we ought to accept the reality.
</p>

<p>
To be ignorant of racial differences is equivalent to denying racial differences, which is equivalent to denying reality.
We can ignore reality, but we cannot ignore the consequences of ignoring reality.
Even if we wanted to ignore racial differences, we could never <i>completely</i> ignore them in practice.
The biological reality of race is still evident when people need <a href="#organ-transplants">organ transplants</a>, <a href="#disease-immunity">when some people are at risk of disease</a> but not others, <a href="#environmental-factors">why racial disparities continue to exist despite social intervention</a>, <a href="#athletic-performance">who tends to wins Olympic sports</a>, and much more.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, knowledge highlighting racial and genetic diversity doesn&rsquo;t always have to be negative, nor should it be.
If different races (and different people) tend to have different strengths and weaknesses, then it makes sense for a rational society to figure out how to leverage every person&rsquo;s strengths, while brainstorming how to mitigate or cover every person&rsquo;s weaknesses.
This cannot be done if we ignore racial and genetic differences.

There is nothing contradictory about being a race realist and non-racist.

We do <i>not</i> advocate that some race(s) be given greater legal privileges than other races.
We believe that all people from any race should be entitled to the same legal rights as anyone else.
We advocate for a eugenostate that would treat all races equally under the law, but there would be competition regarding who is authorized to reproduce who is forbidden.
It is likely that some races would be more reproductively successful than others under a eugenostate since some races are better adapted to modernity than others (on average), but there would be absolutely <i>no</i> legal limitations preventing people from <i>any</i> race from being able to have children.
Eugenostates value equal opportunities, not equality of outcomes.
</p>

<p>
Over time, <a href="../FAQs/eugenics-FAQs#race-gaps">eugenics could even erase the achievement gaps and discrimination between races</a>, if enough natural selection occurs.
This would maximize true racial equality because all the world&rsquo;s races would be as intelligent, low-crime, and productive as any other.

<p>
All race realists acknowledge that <a href="https://thuletide.wordpress.com/2023/01/04/correction-on-ashkenazi-iq-is-it-as-high-as-they-claim-genetic-evidence-indicates-that-it-is/">Ashkenazi Jews</a> and <a href="https://www.sebjenseb.net/p/most-accurate-national-iqs-possible">East Asians</a> have the highest average IQs (and lowest crime rates) of any race on Earth.
This is verified by the consistent results on culture-free IQ tests like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices">Raven&rsquo;s Progressive Matrices</a>.
If race realism was really just pseudoscience aimed to justify white supremacy, then whites would be shown at the top of the IQ tests, but that&rsquo;s not what the data shows.

Lastly, I (Zero Contradictions, the author of this blog) am half European (mostly German) and half Japanese and Cantonese.
I am certainly not a white supremacist since I am mixed-race, as is most of my entire family since both of my parents, all my siblings, and all of my aunts and uncles are also hapas.

<h3 id="races-better-than-others"><span class="section-number-3">3.3.</span> Do race realists believe that some races are better than others?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-races-better-than-others">
<p>
This depends on what is meant by &ldquo;better&rdquo;, and in what context.
No respectable race realist would say that there is a &ldquo;master race&rdquo; or a &ldquo;racial hierarchy&rdquo;, because the whole reason why races are different from each other in the first place is because they each evolved genes and traits that enhanced their ancestors&rsquo; ability to reproduce in their respective environments.
For example, it is easier for Sub-Saharan Africans to live near the equator than Europeans because they have genetic resistance against diseases like skin cancer and malaria.
On the other hand, it&rsquo;s harder for black people to live in a place like pre-Industrial Europe (compared to white people) since they would be more prone to Vitamin D deficiency, would probably have lactose intolerance, and other factors.
Race Realism is about understanding that every race has genes that made them more reproductively successful in their ancestral environments, hence why different races tend to excel at different things.
</p>

<p>
Even if it were the case that one race was always &ldquo;better&rdquo; than the others <i>on average</i>, <a href="#averages-and-exceptions">there are still statistical outliers for every race</a>.
Hence, it&rsquo;s not reasonable to treat people differently based on nothing but their race.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-racists">
<p>
Part of this has to do with memetics and how ideologies evolve over time.
As explained in <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-rise-and-fall-of-alt-right.html">&ldquo;The Rise and Fall of the Alt-Right&rdquo;</a>, the Alt-Right started out as an intellectual movement, until it degenerated into a <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-communists-who-took-power-in.html">Utopian Ideology</a> that got dumber and dumber since ideologies need to tap into human emotions in order to propagate most effectively.
When the ideology started spreading via emotions instead of reason, this caused all sorts of purity spiraling where the leaders and members of the movement started promoting less rational and more extremist ideas in an attempt to claim status over other members of the movement.
<a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/07/status-pyramid-schemes.html">&ldquo;Status Pyramid Schemes&rdquo;</a> talks more about how memetic ideologies propagate and evolve in general.
</p>

<p>
The second reason why some race realists tend to be racist is that racist people are more likely to likely to believe that there are innate genetic differences between races in general.
But they don&rsquo;t necessarily have the intellectual or the bio-evolutionary knowledge for fully understanding race from a scientific perspective.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, the promotion of race realism doesn&rsquo;t need to be driven by racism, emotions, or deplorable claims to social status, nor does it need to conclude that different races should have <a href="#not-racists">unequal rights</a> or <a href="#averages-and-exceptions">be treated unequally</a>.
Race realism is ultimately supported by reason and scientific evidence.
There are some racist people who promote race realism, but that doesn&rsquo;t invalidate the facts.
To insist otherwise is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_fallacy">guilt by association fallacy</a>.

In the 2004 democratic transhumanist book Citizen Cyborg, bioethicist James Hughes criticized the premise and influence of the film <i>Gattaca</i> as fear-mongering, arguing:

<li>Astronaut-training programs are entirely justified in attempting to screen out people with heart problems for safety reasons.</li>
<li>In the United States, people are already screened by insurance companies on the basis of their propensities to disease, for actuarial purposes.</li>
<li>Rather than banning genetic testing or genetic enhancement, society should develop genetic information privacy laws such as the U.S. Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act signed into law on May 21, 2008 that allow justified forms of genetic testing and data aggregation, but forbid those that are judged to result in genetic discrimination. Citizens should then be able to make a complaint to the appropriate authority if they believe they have been discriminated against because of their genotype.</li>

More to the point, most people underestimate how much social status is determined by genetics.
Humans have essentially lived under social caste-based societies with low, stable social mobility for nearly all of human history.
We essentially already live in a world where <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#intelligence-inheritability">intelligence</a>, <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#race-is-biological-examples">fitness</a>, social status, socio-economic mobility, etc are all mainly determined by genetics.

<li>More succinctly, if we want to improve the public perception of some demographics, then we need to eliminate the people who are creating negative perceptions of the demographic, and thus ruining the public perception of the demographic as a whole.</li>
<li>As the collective performance of their demographics improve, the negative perception of those demographics having higher crime and lower intelligence will disappear, which will benefit people from those demographics more and more as they get better and better.</li>

<li>Increasing policing and locking up criminals in neighborhoods that have high crime rates would reduce the amount of crime in those neighborhoods.

The possibility that statistical outliers may exist within a data set is precisely the reason why racism is irrational.
Even if race A has consistently lower crime rates and consistently higher average IQs than race B, it would be dangerous to assume that that would be the case for <i>every single person</i> belonging to race A.
It would be equally wrong to assume that <i>every single person</i> belonging to race B is going to be less intelligent or more likely to commit crimes that every single person from race A.
In order to ensure a meritocracy, individuals must always be treated based on merit, not congenital demographic properties.

It&rsquo;s true that Amerindians and Sub-Saharan Africans commit disproportionately more crimes than Europeans, East Asians, East Indians, etc.
But it is simultaneously true that most people from those races are law-abiding and don&rsquo;t commit any crimes.
Similarly, the smartest people who ever lived may have been European or East Asian, but that does not conclude that every European or East Asian is going to be a genius.
Generally speaking, the people who commit crimes and the people who have built humanity&rsquo;s greatest inventions tend to be on the extreme tail ends of the normal curve(s).

<li>Denying the biological validity of race and the existence of these five major racial groups was popularized after the 1960s, spiking around the 1980s.</li>
<li>Present-day Western scientists, who are located in the epicenter of race-denialism, are split around 50/50 on the issue of race.</li>
<li>The global scientific consensus is overwhelmingly opposed to race-denialism. Half of the scientists of a handful of Western countries deny race, while the rest of the world unquestioningly accepts race as a basic fact of nature.</li>
<li>Human &ldquo;races&rdquo; were historically viewed as distinct subspecies.</li>
</ol>
<p>
While we don&rsquo;t endorse dividing humanity into the same five traditional racial groups, we do acknowledge that <a href="https://thuletide.wordpress.com/2022/04/15/the-history-of-racial-anthropology-and-human-taxonomy/">it reflected reality reasonably well</a>, given the lack of further knowledge and the technological limitations of past times.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s also worth pointing out how <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Racialism#Scientific_consensus:_Races_aren.27t_useful">RatWiki&rsquo;s Racialism article</a> has a misleading section, &ldquo;Scientific consensus: Races aren&rsquo;t useful&rdquo;.
The quotes in that section each repeat that racial categories are not discrete, even though <a href="#continuum-cline-fallacy">all race realists already acknowledge this</a>.
Furthermore, most of the quotes were cherry-picked from anthropologists, not biologists.
RatWiki doesn&rsquo;t want to show what the biologists&rsquo; consensus on race is, because it would expose how they&rsquo;re misrepresenting the academic consensus on race.
RatWiki&rsquo;s editors are interested in confirming their biases, not intellectual honesty.

That has been true historically, but recognizing the invalidity of those arguments does not disprove race realism.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-IQ-scores">
<p>
Saying &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no objective way to define intelligence&rdquo; is not an argument against one definition or for another.
We could just as easily say &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no objective way to define &lsquo;chair&rsquo;&rdquo;.
It&rsquo;s just <a href="../epistemology/reasoning-skills#tactical-nihilism">tactical nihilism</a>.
</p>

<p>
So, we certainly can define intelligence, and IQ tests have been the best way to estimate it.
IQ is a useful metric <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-iq-question.html">as long as you understand what it is and what it isn&rsquo;t</a>.
The misconceptions about IQ revolve around misunderstanding what it measures, what affects it, and how it is calculated.
Anybody who denies that it&rsquo;s possible for IQ scores to be a valid measure of cognitive abilities would also have to reject <a href="../epistemology/axiology#g-factors-and-s-factors">the validity of all the other concepts in this list</a>, lest they would have contradicting beliefs.
Like many things, it is impossible to <i>directly</i> measure intelligence, so <i>indirect</i> measurements of intelligence are the next best information that we can collect and analyze.
</p>

<p>
IQ is a useful metric because it has predictive power for measuring things beyond &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo;, such as educational attainment, income, health, longevity, criminality, getting and staying married, etc.
Indeed, the g hierarchy in the depiction below works for a host of other things past intellectual abilities.
<b>People who are good at IQ tests are hardly only good at taking IQ tests.</b>
</p>

<p>
An individual&rsquo;s IQ score will tend to be stable.
That is, repeat testing will tend to give roughly similar results.
We all know of occasions where we have freak results from tests, but if you tended to test significantly above average in one instance, you are likely to keep getting scores on the high side.
IQ can be influenced by environmental manipulation, but there are also effective ways to eliminate that.

This is a schematic layout of the findings of one particular investigation to the genetic architecture of IQ (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4758834/">Panizzon et al, 2014</a>), and captures our basic findings on the matter.
At the top, and behind all cognitive ability is a central &ldquo;<i>g</i>&rdquo; factor (initially for &ldquo;general intelligence&rdquo;), which is behind the various major mental domains, which themselves have an impact on specific tested abilities, as seen here.
The effectiveness of any mental endeavor, especially the more cognitively demanding ones (i.e. the ones that require you to &ldquo;think&rdquo;) will depend on an underlying mental &ldquo;horsepower&rdquo; so to speak.
<i>g</i> is that horsepower.

There is no consensus on whether intelligence is genetic.
</p>

</div>
<p>
If this claim were true, then the difference in intelligence between a human and a chimpanzee (or any other animal) would have to be purely environmental.
Only a modicum of common sense is needed to realize that this simply isn&rsquo;t true.
Intelligence is obviously affected by genetics.
A more charitable interpretation of this claim is that there is no consensus on <i>the extent</i> to which intelligence is determined by genetics.
In the rest of this essay, we can confidently say and explain why intelligence is <i>mostly</i> determined by genetics.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="org075722d">
<p>
IQ tests are culturally biased against Blacks, Hispanics, and other ethnic groups.
</p>

</div>
<p>
If this claim were true, then Blacks and other ethnic groups should perform worse on IQ tests relative to their &ldquo;true&rdquo; intelligence.
If so, then IQ tests would under-predict their real-world performance relative to Whites.
But we see exactly the reverse.
<a href="http://www.lagriffedulion.f2s.com/dct.htm">IQ tests over-predict the performance of individuals from lower-scoring groups</a>, and Blacks do worse in real-life than we would expect from their IQ scores alone.
Cultural bias cannot be an explanation, especially when we notice that each racial/ethnic population performs roughly equally well regardless of what country they live in.
It&rsquo;s hard to reconcile a &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; bias that seems to be consistent across different cultures.
The simpler explanation is that Blacks have lower IQs due to genetic factors.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, we know that there are visible physiological correlates with IQ, such as head and brain size, as well various anatomical features of the brain, such as cortical thickness (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26449760/">Pietschnig et al 2014</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04513">Shaw et al 2006</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289613001037">Menary et al 2013</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3070152/?report=classic">Karama, Deary, et al 2011</a>).
A recent research team found that they were able to accurately gauge IQ from brain MRI imagery alone (correlation of 0.72 between prediction based on imagery and test-measured IQ – <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0117295">Wang et al 2015</a> – see also Steve Hsu, <a href="https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2015/04/iq-prediction-from-structural-mri">Information Processing: IQ prediction from structural MRI</a>).
</p>

<p>
Lastly, while we do acknowledge that IQ is a valid measure of multiple cognitive abilities with strong predictive power for life outcomes, we caution against anybody who wants to extrapolate beyond IQ.
There are many mental abilities that IQ doesn&rsquo;t measure, such as the ability to learn or the ability to explain things.
IQ also doesn&rsquo;t measure psychological or personality traits within populations, such as psychopathy, aggression, extraversion vs introversion, etc.
IQ isn&rsquo;t everything, but it does accurately foreshadow many things, when it&rsquo;s understood and used correctly.

<h3 id="mental-traits-inheritance"><span class="section-number-3">4.3.</span> No one has found a gene for intelligence, criminality, or any behavioral trait, so behavioral traits can&rsquo;t be inherited.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-mental-traits-inheritance">
<p>
This claim reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of genetics and how genes work.
Firstly, the genome is not like a shopping list, where there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between each &ldquo;gene&rdquo; and some phenotypic feature.
Rather, genes are like a recipe.
Physical<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> traits only emerge through the complex interaction of <i>all</i> the genes in the genome.
As such, most traits (especially behavioral ones<sup><a id="fnr.1.100" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>) are polygenic.
They depend on the action of <i>many</i> genes, so the whole idea that there is a (single) &ldquo;gene for&rdquo; X trait is generally misleading.
In fact, research shows that at least 84% of all genes are expressed primarily or exclusively in the brain.
This creates a multitude of different potential behavioral phenotypes that people could have
(<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001453#pbio.1001453-Hawrylycz1">Ball, Gilbert, &amp; Overly, 2012</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4243026/">Hawrylycz et al, 2012</a>).
</p>

<p>
Moreover, <a href="#behavioral-differences">some genes that cause different behavioral traits</a> have been identified in humans.
However, many of the genes and traits listed in that section were relatively easy to identify since they tend to follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance">Mendelian inheritance</a>.
Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Mendelian_inheritance">non-Mendelian inheritance</a> is actually more common for traits than Mendelian inheritance, <a href="https://gwern.net/doc/genetics/heritable/emergenesis/index">some researchers have proposed emergenesis</a> as a new theory for addressing the difficulty in identifying the relationships between genes and polygenic traits.
</p>

<p>
The other fallacy here is that it&rsquo;s not necessary to know which genetic variants lead to variation in a trait to know that trait variation is affected by genetic variation.
It&rsquo;s true that there&rsquo;s been little success in pinpointing the relevant genetic variants that produce variation in intelligence or behavioral traits (so far).
But that&rsquo;s also true for human height.
As of 2017, <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-02-genes-height-revealed-global-people.html">only 27.4% of the genes responsible for height have been identified</a>.
No one would deny that how tall you are is heavily dependent on your genes, yet we have a hard time finding which genes make the difference.
The same is true for most behavioral traits.
</p>

<p>
Classic behavioral genetic methods, such as twin and adoption studies, are enough to establish the high heritability of intelligence and behavioral traits by themselves.
Likewise, Genome-wide Complex Trait Analyses (GCTA) provide direct verification by showing that genetic similarity across large populations is related to variation in intelligence and many physical and behavioral traits.
These unambiguously demonstrate that the genes under examination are related to trait variation.
Differences between groups and individuals can therefore be pinned to genes that differ between groups and individuals, even if we don&rsquo;t know which genes are responsible for the variation or how they interact with each other.

<li>Brain tissue is very energy-demanding, so that&rsquo;s a major disadvantage to having a larger brain.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It&rsquo;s well-documented that greater brain size strongly correlates with higher IQ, and vice versa (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26449760/">Pietschnig et al 2014</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04513">Shaw et al 2006</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289613001037">Menary et al 2013</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3070152/?report=classic">Karama, Deary, et al 2011</a>).</li>
<li>We know that brain size correlates with intelligence in animals because smarter animals tend to have bigger brains.
So it doesn&rsquo;t make intuitive sense to posit that there&rsquo;s no correlation between brain size and IQ in humans.
As an example, <a href="https://ramonlandia.com/exploring-the-complex-neurology-of-pandas/">giant pandas have relatively smaller brains compared to other bears</a>, which was probably an adaptation to their low energy density diet.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s also well-documented that some races have larger brain sizes than others, and that brain size is mainly determined by genetics (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/abs/race-brain-size-and-iq-the-case-for-consilience/D401BDC4503789499DB856E5267C7619">Rushton 2004</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289604001357">McDaniel, M.

</ul></li>
<li>Larger cranial/brain sizes make human childbirth more difficult and more dangerous. They also require larger pelvis structures and longer pregnancies. The former makes the body less efficient at running.</li>
<li>If the brain requires further growth during infancy and childhood (during which an individual is dependent on others for survival), then there is a longer period until the brain reaches maturity, which is another disadvantage.</li>
<li>IQ and giftedness tend to positively correlate with higher introversion (<a href="https://archive.org/details/sim_personality-and-individual-differences_1998-02_24_2/page/187">Source</a>), while extroversion tends to positively correlate with EQ and higher social intelligence. There are benefits to introversion, but there&rsquo;s no reason to assume that introversion is <i>always</i> more advantageous than extroversion in all scenarios.</li>
<li>IQ and myopia both tend to positively correlate with each other. The usual environmental explanation is that higher IQ people spend more time reading and studying, which worsens eyesight. However, a possible genetic explanation is that greater brain matter (and thus higher IQ) creates more pressure on the eyes, which worsens eyesight. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5382686/">Source</a></li>
<li>There are numerous successful animal species with small or nonexistent brains.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s well-known that higher IQ <i>negatively</i> correlates with fertility in the world&rsquo;s modern environment.</li>
<li>Even between members of the same race (for any race), <a href="#averages-and-exceptions">individual intelligence tends to vary from person to person</a>.
If higher intelligence was universally adaptive in <i>all</i> environments, then we should expect everybody to be equally intelligent and expect every person on Earth to be a brilliant genius.
This does not match what we observe in reality.
We also observe that <a href="#intelligence-inheritability">intelligence is mainly determined by genetics</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
It clearly doesn&rsquo;t follow that increased intelligence <i>always</i> improves reproductive success.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
However, we can observe that increases in IQ seem to be linked to the growth of civilization: laws, money, writing, math, etc, or things that require abstract reasoning.
It&rsquo;s likely that some environmental circumstances are more likely to produce more complex civilizations (and hence higher IQs) than others.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If a human population has a high rate of disease, that can prevent overpopulation, and thus prevent any wars that would otherwise be caused by said overpopulation.</li>
<li>The existence of seasons creates environmental and seasonal conditions requires that humans must plan ahead by months if they are to survive and reproduce.

<li>They must prepare so that they don&rsquo;t starve or freeze during winter.</li>
<li>They must also prepare and deduce efficient agricultural practices according to seasonal changes.</li>

Aren&rsquo;t most / all racial disparities better explained by environmental factors?
</p>

</div>
<p>
No. If there exist racial disparities and achievement gaps between races, and <a href="#what-is-race">different races are defined by having different genetics</a>, then Occam&rsquo;s Razor concludes that genetic differences should be the default hypothesis for explaining why racial disparities exist.
That doesn&rsquo;t mean we assume that every difference is genetic, but that is the default explanation.
We should only consider other explanations if there is data that cannot be explained by the simplest explanation (i.e. genetic differences).
</p>

<p>
The causal connection between environment and social outcomes is no more straight-forward than the causal connection between genes and social outcomes.
We know that genes affect brain development.
We also know that social outcomes are affected by individual actions, and individual actions are generated by brains.
So, there is no mystery about the causal pathway between genetics and social outcomes.

Evolved differences in mental traits are no less likely than evolved differences in skin color, hair type, bone structure, <a href="#disease-immunity">disease immunity</a>, <a href="#human-diet">metabolism</a>, etc.
The belief in the equality of mental traits between races is a religious assumption.
It has no rational/scientific basis.

<div class="opponent" id="org8285e84">
<p>
Arguing that genetic differences should be the default hypothesis for racial disparities is a correlation-causation fallacy.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Occam&rsquo;s Razor is a necessary principle for logical induction, not a correlation-causation fallacy.
A correlation-causation fallacy is when one leaps from &ldquo;A is correlated with B&rdquo; to &ldquo;A causes B&rdquo; without considering other possible explanations.
For example, it would be a fallacy to leap from &ldquo;Poverty is correlated with crime&rdquo; to &ldquo;Poverty causes crime&rdquo; without considering other possible explanations, such as &ldquo;Poverty and crime are both affected by genes&rdquo;.
In most cases, correlation does imply some causal relationship.
You can find spurious correlations, if you go looking for them, but obvious correlations usually have a causal explanation.
The point of the correlation-causation fallacy is that we can&rsquo;t assume a direction of causation from a correlation.
</p>


<div class="opponent" id="org7fc1950">
<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rich because mom and dad left me money and a house&rdquo; fits Occam&rsquo;s Razor better than &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rich because mom and dad left me good genes that enhanced my earning potential&rdquo;.
</p>

</div>
<p>
This hypothetical example fails from the get-go to eliminate the influence of genetic differences when it&rsquo;s trying to argue for environmental differences.
Perhaps white parents are more likely to become richer and wealthier than black parents because European genes are better suited towards achieving higher SES on average.
If so, then of course white parents would have more money and wealth to pass onto their children, compared to black parents.
If the white children also had better genes for enhancing their earning potential compared to the black children, then that would further compound the effects for the hereditarian hypothesis.
</p>

<p>
The way how parents raise their children is genetic too, not just the way how children behave.
It might be true in some cases that bad people would&rsquo;ve grown up to be better people if they had better parents.
But it&rsquo;s more likely in most cases that &ldquo;bad&rdquo; behaviors are caused by genetics, and that bad parents naturally pass on bad mannerisms when they raise their children.
The children are also more likely to become &ldquo;bad&rdquo; if they inherited their parents&rsquo; genes.
</p>

<p>
Since neighborhoods are composed of people, it also fits Occam&rsquo;s Razor better to conclude that good people make good neighborhoods and bad people make bad neighborhoods rather than the other way around, generally speaking.
Bad neighborhoods can have negative effects on the people who live in them, but it doesn&rsquo;t fit Occam&rsquo;s Razor as well to suppose the opposite conclusion is stronger, i.e. good neighborhoods make good people, and bad neighborhoods make bad people.
</p>

<p>
Note that we are <i>not</i> denying that environmental factors at least partially contribute to racial disparities.
We&rsquo;re just saying that environmental factors aren&rsquo;t the <i>main</i> cause.
Most race realists would generally estimate that racial disparities are ~80-88% genetic and ~12-20% environmental.
By contrast, many (most?) race denialists would say that racial disparities are 0% genetic and 100% environmental, so this suggests that the race realist position is more nuanced than the position presented by most race denialists.
</p>

<p>
We can investigate what proportion of the variance in a given sample is explained by environmental factors, and what proportion is explained by genetics.
If we eliminate the environmental factors one after another (iodine, malnutrition etc), the proportion of the variance that is explained by genetics + random noise will definitionally approach 100%.
Of course if we ignore that, it can be said that any trait is both 100% genetic and 100% environmental in an absolute sense, a phenotype being the expression of genes in an environment.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, if one labels the idea that some races are <i>innately</i> predisposed to commit more crimes than others as &ldquo;racist&rdquo;, then it&rsquo;s contradictory to not also label the idea that <a href="../images/dooku.jpg">men have an innate disposition to commit more crimes than women</a> as &ldquo;sexist&rdquo;.

For the record, an adverse environment with severe poverty (e.g. modern-day sub-Saharan Africa) <i>does</i> have a negative effect on IQ.
Hence, the average IQ in sub-Saharan Africa is somewhat lower than what it could be under optimum conditions.
However, we can&rsquo;t reduce all racial IQ differences to environmental deprivation.
It&rsquo;s not the main factor.
</p>

<p>
Identical twin studies and adoption studies make it easy to separate the genetic factors from environmental factors regarding the variance among individuals.
When we examine identical twins who were raised apart (thus isolating genetics as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_variable">control variable</a>), we see that they are still similar in IQ.
The inheritability of IQ and behavioral traits is very stable throughout life, reaching into the 0.8-0.9+ range during adulthood when genes have been given the chance to fully express themselves.
This means, out of a group of people, at least 80-90% of the variance between them can be attributed to genetic differences.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, we could compare adoptive siblings who live under a &ldquo;shared environment&rdquo; (thus isolating environment as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_variable">control variable</a>).
The impact of environmental factors is consistently 0.
Adoptive siblings might as well be random strangers for the degree of similarity between them in intelligence, behavioral traits, or outcomes.
The research conclusively tells us that there aren&rsquo;t any such lasting potential effects from parenting or upbringing.
For differences between groups, it follows that the provably high heritability of behavioral traits and the reality of <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#race-is-biological-examples">genetic racial differences</a> that differences in intelligence between races must also heavily genetic.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-black-white-IQ-gap">
<div class="opponent" id="org9f99135">
<p>
But research has shown that <a href="http://www.iapsych.com/iqmr/fe/LinkedDocuments/dickens2006a.pdf">the black-white IQ gap has decreased from 1972 to 2002</a>.
</p>

</div>
<p>
Yes, it has.
IQ is estimated to be ~20% environmental (like height and many other hereditary traits), and the black-white IQ gap in the United States has certainly shrank since the 1960s due to the improving environmental circumstances and living standards of African-Americans since then.
This is a good thing because all races deserve equal rights and equal treatment in our political and economic systems.
However, <a href="https://humanvarieties.org/2013/01/15/100-years-of-testing-negro-intelligence/">the black-white IQ gap is no longer narrowing</a>.
</p>

<p>
The IQ gap between African-Americans and Sub-Saharan Africans is currently estimated to be ~15 points (~85 vs ~70), but this is also probably genetic to a great degree as well.
<a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/genetic-study-reveals-surprising-ancestry-many-americans">One source</a> estimates the African-American genome to be nearly ~25% European, and almost ~4% of European Americans carry African ancestry.
Other sources and analyses return somewhat different numbers, but the main reason why most African Americans have inherited so much European ancestry is because white slaveowners had a history of raping their black female slaves and creating mixed-race offspring.
It&rsquo;s no coincidence that the amount of European ancestry in African Americans tends to correlate with how high their IQs are.
The rest of the 15 point IQ gap between African-Americans and Sub-Saharan Africans must be caused by the differing environmental standards between the United States and Sub-Saharan Africa, like the factors mentioned in the paper by James Flynn.
</p>

<p>
Besides environmental factors, the abolition of miscegenation laws and increased race-mixing between blacks and whites (and other races) since the 1960s has likely decreased the black-white IQ gap as well to some extent.
Race-mixing will probably continue to increase in the future, which may further reduce the gap.
Consider the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interracial_marriage_in_the_United_States#Census_Bureau_statistics">stats on interracial marriages from the 2010 US Census</a> for example.
</p>

<p>
If North America can eliminate <a href="../civilization/social-justice#demographic-quotas">demographic quotas</a>/discrimination against whites and Asians, eliminate <a href="#anti-white-ideology-in-west"><del>Critical Race Theory</del> leftist propaganda</a>, and implement better economic policies like <a href="../civilization/georgism-crash-course">Georgism</a>, we can isolate nearly all environmental factors and show that the racial disparities between whites and blacks would still largely persist due to genetics.

</p>

<p>
In today&rsquo;s world, IQ tests show that East Asians have higher IQs than Europeans, on average.
However, this seems at odds with how a greater number of historical intellectual discoveries have been made by Europeans, compared to East Asians.
A common explanation for this discrepancy is that East Asians lack creativity and ingenuity, despite being smarter.
Supposedly, East Asians aren&rsquo;t as good as Europeans at inventing new ideas, for whatever reason.
However, we should expect creativity to correlate with IQ in most cases, so we need to theory to explain why the correlation doesn&rsquo;t occur in this case.
</p>

<p>
The theory that I propose is that East Asians <i>are</i> marginally smarter than Europeans <i>on average</i> (according to <a href="../epistemology/axiology#g-factors-and-s-factors">IQ metrics</a> in the present-day), but the reasons why Europeans made most of the inventions of modern civilization are:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Europeans might have higher <i>variation</i> in their IQs and intelligence, and therefore have/had a slightly larger number of &gt;130 IQ individuals, even though their average IQ is slightly lower than the average East Asian IQ.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is plausible since the European marriage pattern made it possible for Europeans with similar traits to breed together, which likely created humans with higher IQs near the right tail of the curve to arise, and possibly also humans with lower IQs near the left tail of the curve.</li>
<li>This is consistent with how European populations are known to have more genetic diversity than East Asians, how East Asian populations have the least genetic diversity of all races (due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect">Founder Effect</a>), and how at least &gt;84% of all genes are expressed primarily or exclusively in the brain (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001453#pbio.1001453-Hawrylycz1">Ball, Gilbert, &amp; Overly, 2012</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4243026/">Hawrylycz et al, 2012</a>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It&rsquo;s been claimed that the average European IQ was the highest it had ever been around the Industrial Revolution, and that it has been steadily declining ever since the start of the Industrial Revolution (<a href="http://iapsych.com/iqmr/fe/LinkedDocuments/woodley2013.pdf">Source</a>). If that&rsquo;s true, then Europeans <i>used to</i> have higher IQs than East Asians, which is believable.</li>
<li>Ashkenazi Jews have made a disproportionate number of technological contributions and innovations, despite their small size. <a href="https://thuletide.wordpress.com/2023/01/04/correction-on-ashkenazi-iq-is-it-as-high-as-they-claim-genetic-evidence-indicates-that-it-is/">The average IQ of Ashkenazi Jews is estimated to be ~110</a>, compared to the average ~100 for most of Europe. There are also many reasons to believe that Ashkenazi Jews had higher selectionary pressures for intelligence than Europeans. Hence, categorizing Ashkenazi Jews as &ldquo;Europeans&rdquo;<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> probably enhances the apparent historical and technological contributions of Europeans, even though non-Jewish Europeans tend to be less intelligent than Ashkenazi Jews, on average.
For more info, see: <a href="../civilization/ashkenazi-jewish-IQ">Why is the Average IQ of Ashkenazi Jews So High?</a></li>
<li>Europeans were better educated during the 19th and 20th centuries following the Industrial Revolution (1750-1970). Since there is a finite number of useful inventions that can be made, it was too late for East Asians to invent many things by the time most East Asian populations were taught literacy and received comparably high-quality educations. Notably, most East Asians also use logographic writing systems, which <a href="../language/logographic-systems-pros-cons">create a stronger barrier to literacy than phonetic writing systems</a>, but <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022096521000606">may improve the spatial reasoning of those whose master them</a>.</li>
<li>The European intellectual tradition was focused on creativity, comprehensiveness, and polymathy. Meanwhile, East Asians selected their elites for millennia by test taking. Thus, it may be the case that East Asians perform better on tests, whereas Europeans to perform better on real world results. In some ways, this seems to match what we observe in reality.</li>
<li>The cognitive abilities of humans that cannot be measured by IQ probably differ between Europeans and East Asians. Hence, the intelligence of a European could be different from the intelligence of an East Asian, even when they have the same IQ scores.</li>
<li>Singapore&rsquo;s IQ was probably raised slightly due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_planning_in_Singapore">its past (dirigiste eugenic) population planning policy from 1966 to 1986</a>.</li>
</ol>


<p>
Another thing to keep in mind is that Europe industrialized before East Asia did (for multiple reasons), and the colonization of China, Korea, and Taiwan by Japan and European powers, followed by the subsequent Communist takeover in China and North Korea have understandably held back East Asian innovation.
Chinese culture would probably be just as influential in the West as Japanese culture is today, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the Communists winning the Chinese Civil War.
</p>

<p>
Most of the world&rsquo;s atheists are in the Western world and East Asia.
It seems that intelligence correlates with the prevalence of atheism.

To answer the question: Yes for the most part, but this does not debunk race realism.
Once again, <a href="#what-is-race">a race is a statistical cluster of genes</a>.
That means that there can be statistical outliers to any generalized claim made about a race(s).
Relatively high-IQ people can come from low-IQ races, and relatively low-IQ people can come from high-IQ races, but when this happens, those people are the statistical outliers of their respective races.
Race realism is the recognition of statistical tendencies that are caused by historical evolutionary patterns, not dogmatic judgments.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-race-gap-educational-and-economic">
<p>
Income and educational attainment is correlated with IQ for all races.
We could interpret this environmentally as income boosting IQ and educational attainment, but we could also interpret this genetically as IQ boosting income and educational attainment.
The former is true to some extent, but the causal relationship in the latter is much stronger.
The average African American has a higher standard of living today than Issac Newton and all the other Enlightenment thinkers who lived in the 1600s, or even the standard of living for European Americans in the early 1900s.
And yet, African-Americans have <i>still</i> failed to achieve the intellectual, educational, or economic achievement of Europeans and East Asians.
</p>

<p>
Racial gaps in IQ and achievement persist in developed countries just as much as they persist in developing countries.
The racial IQ and achievement hierarchy that is visible in the United States is found all over the world.
In every country on Earth, Blacks statistically do poorly in comparison to Europeans.
Likewise, East Asians and Ashkenazi Jews collectively do well all around the world, better than Europeans do.
Across the globe and across very different societies and economic systems, we see roughly the same pattern as we see in the United States.
This is true with populations who have been in these respective countries for many generations (e.g. Brazil).
Even if someone came up with some cultural explanation for any particular society, it wouldn&rsquo;t explain the consistency in global racial disparities.
</p>

<p>
Average IQ positively correlates very strongly with national development, in measures such as GDP per capita.
Some countries lag behind despite receiving decades of foreign aid and assistance, while others have done well despite having few natural resources.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="orgc5d8632">
<p>
Wealth disparities are responsible for observed national IQs.
</p>

</div>
<p>
This is untenable upon close examination.
When looking at the outliers from this pattern, one can see that average wealth does not affect national outcomes in IQ.
For example, people from impoverished interior China tend to perform better on IQ tests than people from wealthy yet not particularly intelligent Middle Eastern oil-exporting nations.

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rich because mom and dad left me money and a house&rdquo; fits Occam&rsquo;s Razor better than &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rich because mom and dad left me good genes that enhanced my earning potential&rdquo;.
</p>

</div>
<p>
This hypothetical example fails from the get-go to eliminate the influence of genetic differences when it&rsquo;s trying to argue for environmental differences.
Perhaps white parents are more likely to become richer and wealthier than black parents because European genes are better suited towards achieving higher SES on average.
If so, then of course white parents would have more money and wealth to pass onto their children, compared to black parents.
If the white children also had better genes for enhancing their earning potential compared to the black children, then that would further compound the effects for the hereditarian hypothesis.

<h3 id="race-gap-single-parents"><span class="section-number-3">5.4.</span> Racial Disparities in Single-Parent Households</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-race-gap-single-parents">
<p>
The rates of violent crime have been falling since the mid-1990s, in spite of a surge in single parenthood during the 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s.
However, the theory that single parenthood causes criminality would predict an increase in violent crime that follows the increase in single parenthood by about 20 years, which is the exact opposite of what happened in the 90s and 2000s.
While this doesn&rsquo;t prove that single parenthood has no effect on crime rates, it&rsquo;s counter-evidence that needs to be considered, along with all the other explanations why crime rates fell during the 90s and onward (the legalization of abortion, better policing tactics, higher incarcerations rates, etc).
</p>

<p>
Instead of single-parent households causing higher crime rates, it could also be the case that people who grew up in single-parent / fatherless households are simply more likely to be less responsible and commit more crime because their parents&rsquo; genes were less responsible in the first place.
Correlation does not imply causation, but genetic factors shouldn&rsquo;t be ruled out in favor of environmental factors just because the former is a more taboo explanation.
A child with good genes would probably perform decently well even without a father present, although they would obviously be better with a father in all cases.
</p>

<p>
Other proposed factors include how <a href="../FAQs/eugenics-FAQs#welfare-states">welfare states and other leftist policies have subsidized the reproduction of genes linked to social and sexual irresponsibility</a>, the breakdown of the Church, and the movement of blacks into urban environments (which makes them even more distant from their ancestral social environment).
Some would even argue that Jim Crow laws helped to maintain the black community, because blacks would have separate black-owned enterprises, and thus there used to be a stronger pathway to financial success and social status.
But even then, whites did not respond to the welfare state in the same way as blacks (on average), so there are racial (and genetic) differences that have a clear effect here.
Genes cannot be rationally dismissed as affecting the racial disparity.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s true that welfare encourages single-motherhood.
But many of the problems in the black family were present at the time of slavery.

<blockquote>
<p>
There is no such thing as &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo; in the US today, but there is &ldquo;father privilege&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
67% of black children live in single parent families, compared to 25% of white children.
This has a big impact on parental investment and household income.
It also has a big psychological effect.
Children need fathers as well as mothers.
Boys need male role models.
Also, fathers are male authority figures, and father-son interaction teaches boys how to deal with male authority.
</p>

<p>
Sexual promiscuity is often associated with violent behavior.
Love and marriage go together, and so do violence and promiscuity.
It’s a basic biological principle.
When paternity cannot be established, males will not invest energy in caring for offspring.
Instead, they will compete for access to females.
</p>

<p>
Having a father is not a privilege, but it is a huge advantage in life.
This advantage is not being denied to black people by white people.
It is being denied to black children by their parents.

<p>
It&rsquo;s a contradiction to insist that the high incarceration of black people (relative to their proportion of the population) is caused by environmental factors, while also insisting that the fact that males make up &gt;90% of the prison population is <i>not</i> caused by environmental factors.
To resolve this contradiction, one would have to pick between one of two options:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There&rsquo;s no such thing as people having innate dispositions to commit more crimes and violence than others. Note that this would imply that the high incarceration rates for men are <span class="underline"><i>completely</i></span> caused by environmental factors, which virtually everybody would disagree with.</li>

<hr>
<div class="opponent" id="orgb3cae30">
<p>
The crime gap can easily be explained by blacks more often being in an economic situation that would encourage theft (being poor), and having worse life prospects.
People are less likely to risk committing crimes if they have better life prospects.
</p>

</div>
<p>
This is a good example of one-sided reasoning, which simply ignores other explanations.
While poverty does correlate with higher crime rates, correlation does not imply causation.
<a href="https://www.emilkirkegaard.com/p/money-and-crime-the-relationship">The available evidence does not support a causation relationship between poverty and crime rates</a>.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the crime gap between races is bigger for murder than for theft, and it is not explained by economics.
Most murders have little or no economic benefit.
The same goes for <a href="https://www.emilkirkegaard.com/p/white-on-black-vs-white-on-black">rapes, which are more likely to be committed by blacks than whites per capita</a>.
Also, there are many natural experiments that support the genetic hypothesis over the wealth inheritance hypothesis.
For example, some minorities quickly rose in social status after immigrating to Western societies with little or no wealth: Ashkenazi Jews, Chinese, Vietnamese, etc.
Countries that were extremely poor, such as Japan after WWII or China in the 1980s, have had huge increases in prosperity.
Their poverty did not hold them back.

White supremacy is the most common motivation for domestic terrorism in the United States.
</p>

</div>
<p>
There seems to be ideological bias regarding what gets labeled as &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo;, so this is a questionable claim.
For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waukesha_Christmas_parade_attack">Waukesha Christmas parade attack</a> was not labeled &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo;.
Neither was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Nashville_school_shooting">2023 Nashville school shooting</a>, although it seems to have been inspired by social/political views.
<a href="https://www.amren.com/features/2022/11/a-tale-of-two-crashes/">Amren has a decent article</a> comparing the Waukesha incident to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally">Charlottesville incident</a>.
I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s any non-partisan statistical analysis on terrorism that clearly defines how it categorizes the motivations of every terrorist act, but <a href="../misc/contact#contact-ZC">people are free to message me if they know of one</a>.
Regardless, terrorism is relatively uncommon compared to other types of crime, so the prevalence of terrorism motivated by racial supremacy does not disprove how some races are innately more likely to commit crimes than others.

<div class="opponent" id="orgaf7f849">
<p>
But most mass shootings are done by white people.
<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/476456/mass-shootings-in-the-us-by-shooter-s-race/">Between 1982 and December 2023</a>, 80 out of the 149 mass shootings in the United States were carried out by white shooters.
</p>

</div>

<p>
This is a red herring fallacy, not an argument against race realism.
From the same data set, blacks make up a somewhat disproportionately higher percentage of mass shootings.
Also, race realism isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;white people good, black people bad&rdquo;.
It&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="#what-is-race">races are real and races differ in average mental traits</a>&rdquo;.
If you look at patterns of murder, there are probably racial differences that go beyond the incidence level.
For example, one stereotype is &ldquo;black men can&rsquo;t shoot&rdquo;, because there&rsquo;s a lot of mass shootings with few deaths where the perpetrator is almost always black.
The carefully planned and executed mass murders take a lot more victims, and they tend to be done by autistic Asians and Europeans.
There&rsquo;s also Muslims who have impressive group agency and suicide attacks.
The bottom line is that different people have (statistically) different behaviors.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
In order for a police force to be truly effective, it&rsquo;s necessary for it to monitor areas with higher crime rates.
Effectiveness is measured by the police&rsquo;s ability to stop and deter crime.
Areas with higher crime rates may happen to have higher Sub-Saharan African, Amerindian, or Hispanic populations, but that doesn&rsquo;t make it &ldquo;racist&rdquo; for police departments to monitor those more closely and more often.
The problem with ghettos is the people who live in those places.
If anything, the best thing that whites could do for blacks is to police the hell out of those neighborhoods.
Increased policing imprisons people who would otherwise be repeat offenders and/or make more offspring who are genetically predisposed to become future criminals.
It also increases the game-theoretic pressure to avoid committing crimes,
Increased policing will lead to less crime.
Less crime thus leads to increased safety and greater prosperity for all.

<li>The Iroquois engaged in wars, cannibalism, slavery, and torture with other American Indians. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois">Source</a></li>
<li>&ldquo;A war party was considered successful if it took many prisoners without suffering losses in return; killing enemies was considered acceptable if necessary, but disapproved of as it reduced the number of potential captives. Taking captives were considered far more important than scalps. Additionally, war served as a way for young men to demonstrate their valor and courage. This was a prerequisite for a man to be made a chief, and it was also essential for men who wanted to marry. Haudenosaunee women admired warriors who were brave in war.&rdquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois">Source</a></li>
<li>&ldquo;The neighbors of the western Cree were Athapascans on the north and northwest, Blackfeet on the west, and Assiniboine on the south. With the Assiniboine they were closely associated from the time of the separation of that tribe from the parent Sioux prior to the opening of the country by exploration in the early years of the seventeenth century; nevertheless, there were rather frequent drunken brawls, with consequent murders, between the two tribes in the boisterous era of the fur-trade. They joined forces in pushing the Blackfeet, Bloods, and Piegan southwestward out of the plains bordering Saskatchewan river, and up to the termination of inter-tribal warfare remained constant enemies of these other Algonquians. The Cree inheritance of the historic Sioux hostility toward the Chippewa was not lessened by the friendly reception they accorded the renegade Assiniboine, for whom the Sioux entertained bitter hatred mixed with professed contempt. The Woods Cree had little, if any, part in this warfare with the Blackfeet and the Sioux; their operations were limited to dispossessing the Athapascans of their territory between the Saskatchewan and Athabasca lake. Peace river, according to Henry, received its name from the circumstance that the Cree and the Beavers settled their hostilities at Peace point. —The North American Indian, Volume 18 (1907)&rdquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Confederacy#Early_expansion_and_the_fur_trade">Source</a></li>
<li>&ldquo;Inuit had trade relations with more southern cultures; boundary disputes were common and gave rise to aggressive actions. Warfare was not uncommon among those Inuit groups with sufficient population density. Inuit such as the Nunamiut (Uummarmiut), who inhabited the Mackenzie River delta area, often engaged in warfare. The more sparsely settled Inuit in the Central Arctic, however, did so less often.&rdquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit#Pre-contact_history">Source</a></li>
<li>&ldquo;Virtually all Inuit cultures have oral traditions of raids by other indigenous peoples, including fellow Inuit, and of taking vengeance on them in return, such as the Bloody Falls massacre. Western observers often regarded these tales as generally not entirely accurate historical accounts, but more as self-serving myths. However, evidence shows that Inuit cultures had quite accurate methods of teaching historical accounts to each new generation. In northern Canada, historically there were ethnic feuds between the Dene and the Inuit, as witnessed by Samuel Hearne in 1771. In 1996, Dene and Inuit representatives participated in a healing ceremony to reconcile the centuries-old grievances.&rdquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit#Raiding">Source</a></li>
<li>The historic accounts of violence against outsiders make it clear that there was a history of hostile contact within the Inuit cultures and with other cultures. It also makes it clear that Inuit nations existed through history, as well as confederations of such nations. The known confederations were usually formed to defend against a more prosperous, and thus stronger, nation. Alternately, people who lived in less productive geographical areas tended to be less warlike, as they had to spend more time producing food. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit#Raiding">Source</a></li>

There&rsquo;s not a single historical account of American Indian tribes that doesn&rsquo;t involve warfare with other tribes.
Once humans are the apex predator, unless there is a very high rate of disease, the majority of deaths will be from warfare because people who let their children die of starvation rather than going to war, be eliminated by those who fight for their children&rsquo;s survival.
There&rsquo;s no way to precisely calculate the actual percentages regarding the historical causes of death since we don&rsquo;t have unbiased samples of the deaths, but we can infer most deaths were from war based on these historical accounts and the biological reasoning given here.
We should also recognize that most of the academic estimates for the number of humans who have historically died from warfare are probably great underestimates because 1. war victims don&rsquo;t get nice noticeable burials, 2. less than 1% of living remains ever get fossilized, and 3. there is an ideological bias in Academia.
</p>

<p>
Some estimates of the pre-Columbian population of the Americas are between 7-10 million, and others estimate ~50 million, but whatever it was, it&rsquo;s likely that it fluctuated a lot with population booms/explosions and war busts.

Human populations can&rsquo;t be kept separate enough for long enough to develop highly distinct races in the modern world anymore.
</p>

</div>
<p>
That&rsquo;s irrelevant. Mixed races inherit qualities from both of their ancestral races, so interbreeding merely changes the statistical genetic frequencies that define the world&rsquo;s races.
And when races do mix, the resulting race inherits the respective percentages of its ancestral races.
Races may be mixing all over the modern world, but mestizos, mulattoes, and hapas are all still different from each other.
Each of them may be half European, but they&rsquo;re still half Amerindian, half sub-Saharan African, and half East Asian respectively.
Thus, they all behave, think, and act differently from each other.
Same with mulattoes, zambos, and blasians (all half sub-Saharan African).

This is not true. To the contrary, human evolution has <i>accelerated</i> during that time.

In short, agriculture led to greatly increased population size.
Increased population meant more individuals in which mutations could appear.
More mutations meant that natural selection had more to work with.
Additionally, the rise of states and the more varied environments created by humans meant stronger and more geographically and temporally variable selective pressures, which further sped up human evolution.
The age estimate of several human alleles (genetic variants) from Hawks et al. can be graphically demonstrated.

<h2 id="race-mixing"><span class="section-number-2">7.</span> What Do Race Realists Think About Race-Mixing?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-race-mixing">
<blockquote>
<p>
Race-mixing is a natural phenomenon that can have both good and/or bad consequences for any biological species.
Unlike species, which almost always go their separate ways after diverging, races split and merge in the same way that waves on a choppy sea split and merge.
A racial category is just a statistical cluster of correlations among genetic variants.
The distributions of variants, and their correlations, change over time.
Races mix, merge, split, appear or disappear for all kinds of complicated historical and geographical reasons.
For example, when Europeans discovered the New World, there was a lot of race-mixing, which lead to the creation of new races, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mestizo">mestizos</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulatto">mulattoes</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambo">zambos</a>.

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I have mentioned on this page that I am mixed-race, so I wouldn&rsquo;t exist without race-mixing, and neither would most humans.
If you go back far enough in history, virtually everybody living today is &ldquo;mixed-race&rdquo; in a sense, and race-mixing was an important part of human evolution.
Modern humans were formed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interbreeding_between_archaic_and_modern_humans">interbreeding between homo sapiens, neanderthals, denisovans, and other hominins</a>, to varying degrees for all the races of the world.
And that doesn&rsquo;t even include all the races that have mixed, merged, split, appeared, or disappeared since then.
For instance, Virtually all modern white people are a <a href="https://thuletide.wordpress.com/2020/08/08/what-is-white-a-guide-for-complete-novices/">mix of Western European Hunter-Gatherers, Early European Farmers, and Proto-Indo-Europeans</a>.
There are both good and bad reasons to support or oppose race-mixing between modern humans, which will covered in the following subsections.
</p>
<table class="noborders"><colgroup><col class="org-left"><col class="org-left"></colgroup><tbody><tr>
<td class="org-left"><img src="../images/archaic-admixture-in-humans-diagram.jpg" alt="Diagram of archaic admixture in modern humans" width="450"></td>

</tr></tbody></table>
<p>
To an extent, the notion of &ldquo;mixing&rdquo; is somewhat misleading, because <a href="#continuum-cline-fallacy">there aren&rsquo;t separate discrete types</a> that are being &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; together.
Rather, existing racial clusters can disappear and/or change, due to different selective pressures and global migration.
In that sense, some level of &ldquo;mixing&rdquo; is always inevitable, since genes are always mixed when a male and female mate and conceive a child.
</p>

<p>
Whether race-mixing is &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; is a normative question — <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/05/what-is-value.html">a question of value</a>. Hence, we cannot evaluate race-mixing without defining the perspective that we&rsquo;re viewing it from or without analyzing its effects. There are three main effects that race-mixing has on society that I&rsquo;ve observed:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Decreased Fitness, versus Increased Fitness. This falls under biological value. (the most obvious one to biological realists)</li>
<li>Racial Discrimination, Conflict, Culture, etc. This falls under psychological and social value. (the most obvious one to basically everyone)</li>
<li>The Dating Market(s) for different ethnicities and sexes. This falls under psychological and social value. (the most obvious one to incels, and people in interracial relationships)</li>
</ol>
<p>
I elaborate on each of these in the next few subsections.
</p>

<p>
Although East Asians tend to have higher IQs than white people, South Asians and Southeast Asians tend have lower IQs than white people on average.
The IQs of the diasporas for these people in Western countries can often differ significantly from the IQs of the people in their ancestral countries due to how the immigration policies of Western countries may have selected for people of higher IQ or lower IQ from various different countries.
Since the US and other Western countries don&rsquo;t have optimally defined racial categories for collecting statistics about race (e.g. distinguishing between East Asians and Southeast Asians in the statistics that they collect), this makes it harder for people to realize the implications that race realism has for humans.
In this essay, I use the terms South Asians to refer to people from the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asians to refer to people from Southeast Asia, and East Asians to refer to people from East Asia.
If I use the term &ldquo;Asians&rdquo; without any other descriptors, I am using it as a shorthand for referring to East Asians specifically.

<h3 id="race-mixing-and-biology"><span class="section-number-3">7.1.</span> The Effects of Race-Mixing on Biology</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-race-mixing-and-biology">
<p>
Biological value is what is good or bad for an organism.
Fitness is the quantitative representation of individual reproductive success.
Race-mixing is good for an organism if it increases its fitness, and bad if it decreases its fitness.
</p>

<p>
A potential disadvantage to race mixing on a global scale could be that populations around the world would become less adapted to their environments, which could cause some concern in some areas, but most of these possible concerns won&rsquo;t matter much in the modern world. Some examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/11/adaptive-coherence.html">Adaptive Coherence</a>: Race-mixing could potentially interfere with a community&rsquo;s adaptive coherence by causing more people to have genes that don&rsquo;t work as well with the memes or culture of a given community, thus reducing fitness and disrupting the cultural character of the community.</li>
<li><a href="#disease-immunity">Disease Immunity</a>: Immune systems tend to be adapted to local conditions, parasites, and diet. However, conditions in the modern world conditions are completely different than they are from the past: parasites are either gone or global, and diet is totally different and globalized. So this doesn&rsquo;t matter much, as far as race-mixing is concerned.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.donoralliance.org/newsroom/donation-essentials/multicultural-groups-and-donation-does-race-matter-in-organ-transplants/">Organ Donation</a>: Organ transplants tend to have greater compatibility and higher success rates with recipients who are of the same race as the donor. But as the world continues to race-mix more and more, this will become less of a problem over time, if it&rsquo;s a problem at all.</li>
<li>Giving Birth &amp; Congenital Malformations: Mixed-race births face <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15390318/">different risks for congenital malformations</a> and <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2008/10/asian-white-couples-face-distinct-pregnancy-risks-stanfordpackard-study-finds">babies born to WMAF couples have some of the highest rates of caesarean deliveries</a> (33.2 percent). But this doesn&rsquo;t matter much either. It&rsquo;s a known fact that babies with genes that cause them to require C-sections to be delivered are becoming more and more common in the modern world, so even if race-mixing causes this to be a slight problem, it&rsquo;s as much of a problem as how the prevalence of C-sections have been increasing. There&rsquo;s much more critical problems to worry about in the modern world.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Et Cetera</li>
</ul>
<p>
For most traits, race won&rsquo;t matter when you take the parent&rsquo;s traits into account.
Good looking parents have good looking children, smart parents have smart children, and tall parents have tall children.
</p>

<p>
Since races tend to already be well-adapted to the respective territories that they inhabit, most of the genes from a race that evolved in a foreign environment are unlikely to improve the fitness of the race living in its local, ancestral environment.
Nevertheless, race-mixing still has the potential to introduce genes that could increase the biological fitness of a population.
For example, <a href="https://australianmuseum.net.au/learn/science/human-evolution/the-denisovans/">the Sherpa people in Nepal have a gene of homo denisovan origin, which makes it easier for them to breathe at higher altitudes</a> and thus makes them more fit for their respective environment.
The Sherpa wouldn&rsquo;t have that gene if homo sapiens never interbred with homo denisovans.
More generally, allowing genetic recombination is important for allowing complex life on Earth:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
There is another mixing process that could be relevant to questions of race, race-mixing and human genetics in general.
There could be co-adapted alleles of different genes that occupy the same region on a chromosome, that tend to be passed together to offspring as a package.
Recombination could break up those packages, not only in the first generation, but in subsequent generations.
Let me explain.
</p>

<p>
DNA is packaged into chromosomes.
You inherit one chromosome from each parent, but the chromosome you inherit is not a copy of one of your parent&rsquo;s chromosomes.
Instead, it is a combination of both of your parent&rsquo;s copies of that chromosome.
During meiosis, crossover mixes the DNA of the parent&rsquo;s chromosomes.
In a sense, sex takes place not only between organisms, but also between paired chromosomes.
Chromosomes &ldquo;mate&rdquo; by mixing their DNA to produce a new chromosome.
As an aside, I believe that recombination is a mechanism to prevent chromosomal competition.
If chromosomes were replicated as units, then there would be the potential for competition between the two copies of a chromosome.
In fact, there can be chromosomal competition between sex chromosomes, which do not recombine.
(See <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002955">here</a> for example.)
</p>

<p>
Recombination would eventually break up these genetic packages, recombining them with the genes on a different strand.
It could be that mixing races, or mixing genetically distant subpopulations (whether we consider them to be races or not) could break up co-adapted gene complexes not only in the first generation, but in subsequent generations.
Crossover could cause a kind of multi-generational &ldquo;regression to the mean&rdquo; that is not true regression to the mean.
If your chromosomes are different, then combining material from them to produce a new chromosome could break up gene complexes.
</p>

<p>
I raise this issue because it is an interesting possibility to consider, but I don&rsquo;t think it is something to worry about in humans.
It is theoretically possible that &ldquo;out-breeding&rdquo; (mating with a more genetically distant person) could cause problems by breaking up co-adapted gene complexes.
On the other hand, in-breeding can also cause problems, such as genetic diseases caused by recessive genes.
</p>

<p>
Nature doesn&rsquo;t have any rules about who breeds with whom.
Organisms mate, produce offspring, and then selection operates on them.
Gene flow is not intrinsically harmful, and it is necessary to bring together beneficial mutations that occur in different populations.
Also, the repeated mixing of DNA forces genes to work well with other genes, and makes the genome more &ldquo;modular&rdquo;.
The constant mixing of DNA by sex might be really important in creating complex life, not only because it allows beneficial mutations to become associated, but also because it prevents DNA from becoming ad hoc, tightly coupled &ldquo;spaghetti code&rdquo;.
Just as reuse in different contexts forces programmers to create cleaner code, the reuse of genetic code in different contexts forces evolution to create cleaner genetic code.

As mentioned in <i><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/05/does-evolutionary-theory-imply-genetic.html">Does Evolutionary Theory Imply Genetic Tribalism?</a></i>, race-mixing between European men and native women proved to be a great reproductive strategy for both sides where both races were able to exchange positive contributions for raising their children together.
From the perspective of the Mestizos and their ancestors, this race-mixing was a good thing.
From the perspective of white nationalists, it was a bad thing.

Race-mixing can sometimes lead to identity problems among the offspring of interracial couples.
However, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2015/06/11/multiracial-in-america/">most mixed-race people say that it hasn&rsquo;t made a difference for them, or that&rsquo;s even been an advantage</a>.
In the latter case, this is likely because <a href="https://gnew.substack.com/p/racial-pride-is-okay">they&rsquo;re proud of their ancestry</a>.
Even if someone argues that the mixed-race respondents to the Pew poll have no idea what it would be like if they were born to only one race, it&rsquo;s still natural for humans to be proud of their race and ancestry, regardless of whatever they are.
<a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/04/altruism-and-selfishness.html">Humans are naturally selfish</a>, and racial pride in one&rsquo;s ancestry and oneself is useful for justifying one&rsquo;s existence and continued survival.
So while this poll and similar ones rely on self-reported data, and while they could have larger sample sizes (n = 1000), it&rsquo;s likely that they&rsquo;re closely aligned with reality.
</p>

<p>
If you can reasonably expect your children to face significant discrimination or outbreeding depression for being mixed-race in the future, it could be better for your future children if you can avoid breeding with other races.
However, this problem will gradually disappear as tolerance for other races continues to increase, and as race-mixing further blurs racial differences.
</p>

<p>
Supposedly, mixed-race children are more likely to have physical and mental health problems.
There&rsquo;s conceivably some truth to this, but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1448064/">the only study that I could find to support this claim</a> had a low sample size.
More studies and greater sampling should be made on this topic before reaching a more definitive conclusion.

<h3 id="social-stability"><span class="section-number-3">7.3.</span> The Effects of Ethnic Diversity on Social Stability</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-social-stability">
<p>
In most ways and most cases, racially homogenous societies are more prosperous and have fewer social problems than racially diverse societies, all other factors being equal.
It&rsquo;s not hard to see why.
Racial homogeneity leads to less racism and inter-racial violence and conflicts between the members of society, and lends well for greater cultural and linguistic unity.
These traits make it easier for all the members to form a collective national identity that redirects the natural competitiveness of life outwards from the group, which <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/07/circles-of-control-and-freedom.html">improves the group&rsquo;s odds at survival and prosperity</a>.
Having a preference to be around people of one&rsquo;s own race is normal and natural.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, we see that racially diverse countries tend to have many more social problems and less national unity.
Sometimes, minority ethnic groups may just be marginalized by the majority (e.g. Catalonians in Spain, Canada and Cameroon (Anglophones vs Francophones), etc).
Other times, conflicts and civil wars where races try to win independence from the larger society are not uncommon (e.g. Yugoslavia, the Balkans, Chechnya, Russians in Ukraine, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Bangladesh vs Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, etc).
Many of these minority groups would be better off if they had independence (or at least more autonomy) from the larger society.
The United Nations and other leftist institutions will probably never admit that multicultural societies tend to be less successful, because it would undermine their agenda.
Nor will the UN admit that realpolitik decisions are more important than &ldquo;international recognition&rdquo; and &ldquo;state sovereignty&rdquo;, because that is what it prides itself on.
</p>

<p>
For some countries, it&rsquo;s simply impossible for them to be racially and culturally homogenous.
For example, Africa has the most ethnic groups of any continent, and most of those ethnic groups have very small populations.
<a href="../images/africa-too-many-ethnicities-to-partition.jpg">It&rsquo;s not possible for those ethnic groups to each have economies of scale on their own</a>, unless many smaller ethnic groups are placed into the same country.
In such cases, a racially diverse society may be undesirable, but it&rsquo;s still more preferable overall among the various ethnicities for practical economic and geopolitical reasons.
</p>

<p>
For <a href="#ethnostates">ethnostates</a>, a major contention is how likely people with mixed-race ancestry are to have political allegiance to the state&rsquo;s interests.
As a mixed-race person myself, my take is that mixed-race people will always distinguish themselves by how they are different from the ethnostate&rsquo;s most dominant group because people naturally distinguish themselves and form their personal identities by how they are different from others.
Every mixed-race person is different.
For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadroon">quadroons (25% black, 75% white)</a> are less likely to be loyal a white ethnostate than <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Quapa">quapas (25% Asian, 75% white)</a>.
This is not a problem as long as mixed-race people continue to support their ethnostates.
In fact, they are likely to do so as long as 1. they would rather side with the ethnostate&rsquo;s dominant ethnicity and political authority over their other ethnicity(ies), and 2. they don&rsquo;t perceive that they&rsquo;re being discriminated against.
</p>

<p>
In the 90s and 2000s, the US had a pretty low level of inter-racial violence and discrimination compared to other multi-racial countries, but unfortunately the mainstream media and leftist ideology have been greatly exaggerating racial conflicts in the country, thus making something that otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t have been much of an issue into one of the country&rsquo;s leading social problems and causing a growing proliferation of anti-white racism.
Much of the racial conflict is motivated by <a href="../civilization/social-justice#equal-representation">wanting the country&rsquo;s races to be equally represented in the media and in positions of power</a>.
The United States is becoming more racially diverse every day, and while it still performs better than most other countries, it&rsquo;s safe to say that the US would be an even more prosperous society if it were a white ethnostate where whites make up a larger percentage of the population, compared to the modern US.
</p>

<p>
Singapore is perhaps the best example there is of a multiracial society that works very smoothly, though much of this can be attributed to its specific racial admixture and governmental policies.
But even among racially diverse societies that don&rsquo;t have much interracial violence or discrimination, we can observe that racial diversity still leads to minor societal problems or inconveniences.
For such countries, it is more common for people to form their identities based on race, since race is one of the main characteristics in how people differ from one another.
Some of these identities cause undesirable discussions in the public discourse that aren&rsquo;t very conducive to a prosperous civilization, but they are otherwise negligible.

<div id="outline-container-multiculturalism" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="multiculturalism"><span class="section-number-3">7.4.</span> The Effects of Ethnic Diversity on Culture</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-multiculturalism">
<p>
To an extent, a multiracial society may also be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism">multicultural</a> society that gains cultural enrichment from the collection of all the various different races cohabiting the same space.
For example, the United States has managed to blend a lot of different European races and traditions together, and while there are clear examples of how this diversity has created a rich and varied culture in the United States, there&rsquo;s also examples of how it has created division instead (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Catholicism_in_the_United_States">Anti-Catholicism</a>, anti-German sentiment during and after WWI, anti-immigrant sentiment, etc).
The extent to which European races and cultures have been successfully mixed together can be attributed to the comparatively lower genetic differences and not-as-drastic culture shocks of all the various European immigrants, in comparison to say mixing white culture with black culture.
Generally speaking though, it isn&rsquo;t necessary to mix races together in order to spread cultural traditions to spread nowadays, especially during the Internet age, international commerce, and mass media.
</p>

<p>
Race-mixing tends to have better outcomes when the races that are being mixed are closely related to each other.
One example includes how Western Hunter Gatherers interbred with Early European Farmers and how their offspring later mated with Proto-Indo-European descendants.
The WHG, EEF, and PIE peoples were closely related, and each separated by a few thousand years of evolution.
Another example is how all the various white immigrants mixed with each other in the United States during the 1800s and 1900s to create mixed-race white offspring.
After the ethnic tensions passed, pretty much all the white immigrants who arrived to the US were well-assimilated, and <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2021/02/the-end-of-american-greatness.html">it created the perfect individualist and hard-working population for creating the most powerful and most prosperous country on Earth</a>.
</p>

<p>
Multi-ethnic countries are more likely to be multilingual.
Being multilingual in each of the country&rsquo;s national languages can have economic advantages if the languages spoken in the country can be used to communicate with other countries (e.g. Switzerland).
But it can also hinder a country&rsquo;s economic progress if the languages aren&rsquo;t widely spoken outside the country (e.g. India, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, DRC, etc).
An overwhelming amount of diversity in indigenous languages creates social and communication barriers.
It also requires more time and education to learn other languages that are spoken inside and outside the country.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
Dysgenics is another consideration regarding race-mixing within a society.
Not all humans are created equally because genes and traits vary from population to population (e.g. IQ, impulse control, psychopathy, etc).
For Western countries, <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/average-iq-by-country">the average IQ for white people is approximately ~100</a> and since whites have the highest IQs in the world besides Ashkenazi Jews and East Asians, if whites were to race-mix with other races, then the resulting offspring would probably have lower IQs on average when compared with the rest of the whites in the society.
Of course, IQ is only one polygenic trait to be considered, and we&rsquo;ve already mentioned from a biological perspective <a href="#race-mixing-and-biology">how race-mixing can have many negative effects on organisms and populations</a> that could make them less biologically fit for the environments that they inhabit.

White Male Asian Female <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/11/30/247530095/are-you-interested-dating-odds-favor-white-men-asian-women">(WMAF) couples are popular</a> in the West when considering how many Asian women marry outside their ethnicity.
Likewise, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/okcupid-race_n_5811840">Asian men and black women are statistically the least desirable races of their sexes</a> when it comes to dating preferences.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interracial_marriage_in_the_United_States#Census_Bureau_statistics">2010 US Census</a> confirms that these trends extend from dating to interracial marriages too, with 8.2% of Asian men marrying outside of their race while 17.5% of Asian women did the same, and that 10.8% of black men married outside of their race compared to 4.6% of black women.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>
This has caused many Asian men and black women to be unable to find other people to date and marry since they are not able to marry outside their race at the same rates.
Meanwhile, the dating market for white people is nearly balanced since the number of white men who are marrying Asian women is compensated by the number of white women who are marrying black men.
These multi-racial dynamics have lead to Asian men and black women being unlikely to get sex, love, and children.

<p>
From a societal perspective, the main problem with race-mixing between Asians and whites is that it deprives millions of Asian men of love, sex, and children.
This wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if fewer Asian women dated outside their ethnicity, or even if as many white women dated Asian men as there are white men dating Asian women.
But this is not the reality.
Aside from that, East Asians have favorable genetics for maintaining modern civilization due to their higher IQs, lower crime rates, and greater propensities for hard work compared to white people, and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2015/06/11/multiracial-in-america/">White-Asian multiracial adults are also the most likely to say that their racial background has been an advantage</a>.
These facts affirm that the dating market imbalance created for East Asian men is the primary disadvantage to race-mixing between Asians and whites, from a societal perspective centered in the Western world.
</p>

<p>
Some people have suggested that black women and Asian men could pair together since they are both the least desired ethnicities of their respected sexes, but I predict that this is unlikely to be a good matching in most situations, otherwise they would&rsquo;ve already done so.
They&rsquo;re too genetically different from each other, not attracted to each other enough, and the average intelligence between the two may be too different for them to be compatible together (although IQ differs a lot between East Asians, Southeast Asians, and South Asians).
Another thing to consider is that black women have the highest testosterone levels of all women, whereas Asian men have the lowest testosterone levels of all men, which helps explain why Asian men and black women both have relatively low desirability.
The difficulty of Asian men and black women trying to find a partner will probably decrease fertility rates slightly, which can be a good thing if the country is on the verge of overpopulation, or a bad thing if the country wishes to boost its population.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="org8b3ed84">
<p>
Why does it matter if white men and Asian girls date? If they both love each other, why should it matter who dates who?

The fact that so many people think this way demonstrates that most people don&rsquo;t consciously or attentively realize the nature of how value judgments for objects are both positive <i>and</i> negative:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Unlike truth, value is not convergent for similar brains. Tom and Joe could have identical brains, but make very different value judgments from their perspectives. For example, suppose that Joe and Tom both want to date Sally. Their value judgments are identical in one way, but opposite in another way. Joe positively values Joe dating Sally, and negatively values Tom dating Sally. Tom positively values Tom dating Sally, and negatively values Joe dating Sally. &#x2013; Blithering Genius, from <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/05/what-is-subjectivity.html">What is Subjectivity?</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the context of the sexual market between the country&rsquo;s ethnicities, we can state the following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Asian male positively values being with the Asian woman and negatively values the White male being with the Asian woman.</li>
<li>The White male positively values being with the Asian woman and negatively values the Asian male being with the Asian woman.</li>
</ul>
<p>
From the individual-centric perspective of the partners in a WMAF relationship, they both positively value race-mixing, since it allows them to be together and procreate together.
From the <a href="https://incels.wiki/w/Ricecel">ricecel&rsquo;s</a> perspective on WMAF relationships, they negatively value that race-mixing since it deprives them of partners to procreate with.
The high rates of inceldom among Asian men is a good example of how race-mixing has noticeably unfavorable consequences on society (especially for incels in particularly), although we should acknowledge that it&rsquo;s also had favorable consequences between WMAF couples as well.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the day, the only thing that matters (as far as reality is concerned) is who has the power to get what they want and make it happen.
Preventing the race-mixing from ever happening in the first place can only be achieved by segregation or preventing the mass immigration of Asians into Western countries.
But that has already happened.
Besides pop-cultural movements that could portray Asian men and black women in a more positive light (e.g. K-Pop has recently given Korean men somewhat higher social status), or shaming Asian women and white men for marrying outside their races, there isn&rsquo;t much else that can be done to prevent a sexual market imbalance for Asian men.
It will suck for the Asian men, black women, and everybody else who ends up being unable to find loving partners, sex, and children for life, but countless people throughout history also lived that way until the day they died.
Their lineages died off, and they were forgotten about forever.
Such is the nature of life.

<p>
Ethnonationalists tend to argue that interracial marriages have higher divorce rates, but it would be more accurate to say that divorce rates generally depend more on race than race-mixing.
For instance, Black + Black marriages have the highest divorce rates, Asian + Asian have the lowest, and WMAF divorce rates are lower than WMWF divorce rates.
The pairing table shown here is pretty much what we would expect to see, based on theory and observation.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-race-mixing-final-thoughts">
<p>
Whether race-mixing is &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; depends on one&rsquo;s values, the races being mixed, and the perspective that it is viewed from.
In my case, I positively value the race-mixing that eventually lead to my creation, and I negatively value race-mixing if it leads to me being deprived of any potential partners to date, marry, and procreate with.
Alternatively, it makes sense to positively value race-mixing when it enables the subject to find a more suitable partner to procreate with.
</p>

<p>
If I had to make a choice from a societal perspective, I would generally oppose race-mixing in most cases.
<a href="#social-stability">There&rsquo;s no evidence that racial diversity confers any major advantages to a society in any real way</a>.
Racially homogenous society are more optimal for creating more stable civilizations.
However, creating <a href="#ethnostates">ethnostates</a> may not be viable in multiracial countries, or even in Modern Western countries where minorities now make up too high of a portion of the population.
Race-mixing is only likely to continue and speed up in the modern world as time passes.
Whites in the West could hypothetically race-mix with East Asians to result in offspring with slightly higher IQs, but race-mixing between whites and East Asians would still cause somewhat negative consequences for society.
Asian men in particular would be the most affected, unless AMWF relationships were to become as common as WMAF relationships.
Until then, this will be the main downside to whites and East Asians cohabiting the same society.
</p>

<p>
Preventing overpopulation, mass immigration, and environmental degradation are much more important problems than miscegenation will ever be.
Modern healthcare and technology eliminate most of the biological concern against race-mixing, assuming that modern civilization won&rsquo;t collapse in the future.
And racial conflicts, discrimination, and imbalances in the sexual market will be gradually reduced over time to an extent if race-mixing and tolerance of other races continues to become more common.
There are also some cases where race-mixing can be a &ldquo;good&rdquo; thing (depending on the perspective).
In the long run, race-mixing won&rsquo;t be a major problem for modern societies that restrict mass immigration and practice <a href="../FAQs/overpopulation-FAQs">population control</a> and <a href="../FAQs/eugenics-FAQs">laissez-faire eugenics</a>.

<h2 id="collectivism"><span class="section-number-2">8.</span> Does Race Realism Promote Collectivism?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-collectivism">
<p>
This depends on the definition of &ldquo;collectivism&rdquo;.
In this case, I define collectivism as: <i>when individuals place the collective above the individual for the sake of the collective</i>, or in other words, when individuals sacrifice their individuality and personal benefit for the collective.
</p>

<p>
To answer the question with respect to this definition, the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo; because biological realism (a more general concept than race realism) entails recognizing that all life (including humans) is intrinsically selfish and figuring out ways to make selfishness work within a society.
Since race realists have a more realistic understanding of race than racial denialists, they&rsquo;re probably more likely to acknowledge that racially homogenous societies tend to be more preferable.
<a href="#ethnostates">They may be in favor of ethnostates</a> for that reason, but that does not count as collectivism.
</p>

<p>
Race Idealists tend to be collectivists, but biological realists are not collectivists because we understand that altruism is self-defeating and cannot exist in human nature:

<h3 id="group-selection-theory-is-false"><span class="section-number-3">8.1.</span> But don&rsquo;t the members of each race evolve together (group selection theory)?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-group-selection-theory-is-false">
<p>
No, they don&rsquo;t.
The group selection theory of evolution is incorrect.
There is no identified mechanism for how such it would actually work in the real world, and group selection theory doesn&rsquo;t explain anything any better than the phenocentric theory of evolution does.
Selfishness occurs on the individual level, so life isn&rsquo;t just a competition between groups, but also between organisms that compete for resources among the other organisms in their respective groups.
</p>

<p>
Humans do often help each other in nature, but this isn&rsquo;t altruism towards one&rsquo;s race or even altruism in general because altruism doesn&rsquo;t exist in nature:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Parents care for their children because they have strong selfish incentives to do so for their own reproductive success.</li>
<li>Kin altruism between siblings is best explained as the parents&rsquo; selfish behavior being expressed in the children as part of their extended phenotype (cooperative children are easier to raise than non-cooperative children). Hypothetically, this could also extend to cousins, as part of the extended phenotype of their grandparents, but the selective pressure would be <i>much</i> weaker.<br>
Even sibling altruism is not a general rule.
It tends to occur in species that have nests, where sibling competition could be very harmful to the reproduction of the parents.
Even in nesting species, sibling competition is very common.</li>
<li>Many of the so-called &ldquo;self-sacrificers&rdquo; over the history of humanity were forced or conscripted by their own societies to fight in said wars. In other cases, their societies brainwashed their minds with propaganda to do what they did.
Another reason why a childless man may voluntarily fight a war to protect his society is that he expects to win the war, and he believes that he can and will rape or marry the other tribe / society&rsquo;s surviving women, if his side wins.
Winning the war provides him with a potential opportunity to become reproductively successful, so his choice is motivated by selfishness.</li>
<li>Stotting/pronking is a demonstration to predators to try catching someone else in the herd that is obviously less physically fit than the pronker.</li>
<li>Friends helping friends is cooperation motivated by selfish interest and the <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/04/family-and-society.html">moral accounting system</a>, not &ldquo;reciprocal altruism&rdquo; (which is oxymoronic since altruism is selfless).</li>
<li>Other purported examples of kin altruism can be further debunked on a case-by-case basis.</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<p>
It is wrong to assume that childless people who do things that help other people in their society or tribe are doing so to benefit their tribe or their tribe&rsquo;s shared genes.
We have desires that are instrumental to reproduction, not automatic desires to reproduce.
So of course it&rsquo;s possible for people to do actions that help others.
It&rsquo;s possible even if those actions don&rsquo;t benefit their own reproduction, and are hence maladaptive.
That remains true regardless of whichever evolutionary selection theory is true.
So, it&rsquo;s not necessary for the phenocentric theory to explain why that happens.
That is not an argument against the phenocentric theory.

<a href="../FAQs/morality-FAQs#kin-selection-theory-bogus">This is false</a>.
Society is not based on altruism at any level: global, racial, national, or even tribal.
It is based on cooperation between selfish individuals.
A society can act in the world as a unit because it has an internal power structure.
That structure also gives it internal coherence.
A society is a <a href="../epistemology/representationalism#subject-object-dichotomy">kind of object and a kind of subject</a>.
A race is neither.

And that is why you don&rsquo;t see racial solidarity (v1).

<h3 id="blood-lines"><span class="section-number-3">8.3.</span> But people who breed with other races are &ldquo;throwing away their blood lines&rdquo;.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-blood-lines">
<div class="opponent" id="orgeb67fe7">
<p>
People who breed with other races are &ldquo;throwing away their blood lines&rdquo;.
They are not preserving their genes.
</p>

</div>
<p>
They are still preserving their genes.
No matter who a person mates with, the child can only inherit ~50% of his/her genes at most.
That doesn&rsquo;t become false just because she/he is breeding with someone of a different race.
To conclude otherwise is a fallacy.
Did the homo sapiens throw away their bloodline when they bred with neanderthals, denisovans, and other hominids?
<a href="https://thuletide.wordpress.com/2020/08/08/what-is-white-a-guide-for-complete-novices/">Or the ancestors of modern people</a>?
Again, it&rsquo;s the genes that get passed on that matters, not the race.
</p>

<p>
Also, <a href="#race-mixing-and-biology">race-mixing doesn&rsquo;t always negatively affect a person&rsquo;s reproductive fitness</a> or adaptivity to the environment.
People don&rsquo;t necessarily value genes just because they have them encoded into their own DNA.
People value genes that make them and their children more adapted to their respective environments.
For example, a person with sickle cell anemia is not going to value having a child who also has sickle cell anemia if they also value their reproductive success.
If procreating with someone of a different race would improve the fitness and other desired qualities of one&rsquo;s prospective children, then race-mixing is warranted and preferred according to the subject&rsquo;s psychological values.
Aside from valuing adaptive genes, in most cases humans would tend to value that their offspring have genes that are the same as their own, if and only if those genes are not maladaptive.
</p>

<p>
More generally, most animals in nature try to mate with as many other animals as possible.
Mating with multiple partners instead of just one increases the genetic diversity of their offspring, which increases the probability that some of their offspring will be successful.
Humans have this natural instinct too, which is why humans have adaptations like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coolidge_effect">Coolidge Effect</a> that motivate us to mate with multiple different partners, rather than just one or someone is the most genetically similar to us.
This is further evidence that the reproduction of successful offspring is the true biological purpose of life.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="orgf4ff266">
<p>
But insisting that only a maximum of 50% of genes are passed on disregards the shared or non-shared genetics in one&rsquo;s mate.
</p>

</div>
<p>
By this logic, group selection theory concludes that it was a mistake for the ancestors of modern white people (<a href="https://thuletide.wordpress.com/2020/08/08/what-is-white-a-guide-for-complete-novices/">Western European Hunter-Gatherers, Early European Farmers, and Proto-Indo-Europeans</a>) to interbred with each other to create mixed-race offspring.
But given that most white supremacists are supportive of the historical race-mixing that lead to their creation, this implies that it&rsquo;s contradictory for them to unilaterally oppose <i>all</i> race-mixing.
It also suggests that they should re-evaluate their opposition to race-mixing.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, virtually nobody (except maybe for the most fervent believers in the genocentric theory of evolution) actually calculates with mathematics how closely genetically related they are to the person that they are mating with just to make sure that the offspring will have as many of their genes as possible.
It&rsquo;s simply ridiculous that anyone would actually prioritize genetic similarity with their partner over other traits that are much more likely to be desirable instead.
The fact that basically nobody thinks that way is further evidence in favor of the phenocentric theory of biological purpose, instead of the genocentric theory.
</p>

<p>
The genocentric theory of evolution also ignores the mutations that every organism inherits, which is an important reason why anyone would be motivated to care for their children instead of other people&rsquo;s children in the first place.
Currently, every human is born on average with ~60 or so new, random mutations, although most are situated in non-coding DNA and are neutral.
So even if someone breeds with someone of a different race, their child will inherit approximately half of their mutations (~30), as well as many of the mutations of that parent&rsquo;s ancestors.
That&rsquo;s 30+ genes that the parent and child uniquely share, that almost no one else has.
This is a big deal because evolution wouldn&rsquo;t be possible in the first place without the genetic variation that mutations provide.
If someone cares for someone else&rsquo;s children instead of their own, those children are probably not going to have any of the mutations that are present in the parent, which is a good reason to favor raising biological children instead of adopted children if the mutations are adaptive, even if the other parent is of a different race.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the whole reason why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_sexual_reproduction#Origin_of_sexual_reproduction">sexual reproduction evolved in the first place as an alternative to asexual reproduction</a> is because it increased the genetic diversity of the descendant organisms, which increased their fitness.
This allowed all sorts of adaptive, interesting, and creative organisms to arise during the Cambrian Explosion and its aftermath that otherwise never would&rsquo;ve spawned into existence.
Organisms that reproduce via sexual reproduction only pass on ~50% of their genes, whereas organisms that reproduce via sexual reproduction tend to pass on ~100% of their genes.
It doesn&rsquo;t matter that sexually reproducing organisms pass on a smaller percentage of their genes because the objective goal and meaning of life is to reproduce, not for an organism to spread genes by producing <i>exact</i> copies of oneself.
Modern humans would not exist today if organisms were supposed to care about having offspring that have as close to ~100% of their genes as possible, instead of caring about reproduction.
Race idealists don&rsquo;t understand this because they don&rsquo;t fully understand evolution.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, if we think about evolution on much longer timescales, then it&rsquo;s inevitable that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HclD2E_3rhI">you may not share any genes with some of your ancestors</a>, even if you are a direct descendant of them.
Conversely, your descendants in the far future may not directly inherit any genes from you, regardless of what races you reproduce with.
Humans have around three billion base pairs, but the number of ancestors doubles for every generation.
That implies that it&rsquo;s not possible to share genes by ancestry or descent between you and <i>all</i> of your ancestors.
This is another reason why it doesn&rsquo;t make sense for parents to obsess about the genetic similarity between them and their children.
It reaffirms that the biological purpose of an organism is to reproduce.
Reproduction is the only link that a person is guaranteed to have between themselves and all of their ancestors.
Reproduction is why life exists at all in the first place.

This next quote was written by a white nationalist in response to <i><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/05/does-evolutionary-theory-imply-genetic.html">Does Evolutionary Theory Imply Genetic Tribalism?</a></i> by Blithering Genius:

<p>
We see the difference in success between North America and South America.
The shipping of brides to North America seemed to produce a radically different society than the one win which the brides were found among the native population of South America.
Does this not contradict this theory a bit?
</p>

</div>

<p>
From the perspective of white nationalists, the race-mixing that happened largely between American Indian women and white European male colonizers was a bad thing when considering the modern societies that that genetic admixture produced, in comparison to the largely white descended population of the United States and Canada.
But we still have to remember that from the biological perspective of the Amerindian women, the race-mixing was a good thing because it enabled them to reproduce and replicate their genes to re-populate the Americas after ~90% the American Indians died of disease.
</p>

<p>
We also have to keep in mind is that the American Indian women had knowledge of how to live off the land, whereas the white colonizers did not.
As Blithering Genius mentions in his essay titled &ldquo;<i>Space Colonization and Industrialization</i>&rdquo; from his book <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPXKWDVC">Futurist Fantasies</a></i>, advanced technology alone would not&rsquo;ve been sufficient for colonizing the Americas in the 1500-1700s because technology depends on the scale of civilization, and more complex levels of technology cannot develop unless the more primitive technologies that created their existence were invented and used beforehand.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps the white colonizers could&rsquo;ve eventually colonized the Americas by breeding with white women to create a purely genetic admixture if they had waited longer to build technology that could help colonize the rest of the Americas, but this undoubtedly would&rsquo;ve taken longer.
And if the colonizers who were there in the American colonies wanted to colonize the Americas as soon as possible, it simply would&rsquo;ve made more sense to breed with an American Indian woman due to their knowledge of how to live off the land.
They would have to have children with the American Indian women in order to incentivize them to care for the descendants of the white colonizers, since those children would be theirs too.
If the European colonizers in the Americas during the 1500s didn&rsquo;t interbreed during that century, then other European men from later centuries would&rsquo;ve populated the continent instead, and that would&rsquo;ve been a loss for their selfish reproductive biological interests.
</p>

<p>
In terms of psychological and social value, most people today who value modern civilization may prefer that the Americas had been populated exclusively or near exclusively by white people instead, but this ignores how the ancestors of the modern inhabitants of Latin America (both the white colonizers and Amerindian women) valued the procreation that created all of their descendants.
Might makes right, and power is self-justifying.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, if white nationalists really want to promote white preservation and stop the <a href="#great-replacement">great replacement</a> (both of which I support), then they should encourage white people to have more kids.
The more kids white people have (irregardless of who they breed with), the greater the white proportion of the gene pool will be.

<div id="outline-container-genetic-similarity-relatedness" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="genetic-similarity-relatedness"><span class="section-number-3">8.5.</span> What is the difference between genetic similarity and relatedness?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-genetic-similarity-relatedness">
<p>
When talking about genetic similarity and relatedness, there are multiple names and multiple definitions for these concepts.
These two concepts are not interchangeable with each other, despite being frequently misunderstood and confused as so.
We need to define and distinguish these concepts:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Genetic Similarity, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_distance">Genetic Distance</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_selection#Hamilton's_rule">Relatedness</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_relationship">Coefficient of Relationship</a>, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_incest#Degrees_of_relationship">Degree of Consanguinity</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
One way to formally define and calculate &ldquo;relatedness&rdquo; between individuals is to use the mathematical formula: <code>1/(2^c)</code> or equivalently <code>2^(-c)</code>, where <code>c</code> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consanguinity">degree of consanguinity</a> between two organisms.
When thinking about genetic relationships, &ldquo;relatedness&rdquo; usually seems like a clear concept because most people only think about the closest relationship that any two organisms share together, rather than <i>all</i> the relationships that two organisms may share between each other via <i>all</i> their common ancestors.
Regardless of however &ldquo;relatedness&rdquo; is defined, it becomes clear that using &ldquo;relatedness&rdquo; to talk about anything is meaningless when we consider that there&rsquo;s usually more than one way how two organisms may be related to each other.
Relatedness is thus <i>not</i> a well-defined concept, as the following text shows:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;Relatedness&rdquo; is not easy to define.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_selection#Hamilton's_rule">Wikipedia says it is &ldquo;the probability that at a random locus, the alleles there will be identical by descent&rdquo;</a>.
But what does &ldquo;identical by descent&rdquo; mean? If we only look back one generation, it seems pretty simple.
You inherit half your DNA from each parent, so for any given allele of a parent, there is a 50% chance that you have inherited a direct copy of that allele.
For any given allele of yours, there is a 50% chance that your sibling inherited a direct copy of the same allele from your parents.
So, by one definition of &ldquo;relatedness&rdquo;, you are 0.5 related to your parents and siblings.
</p>

<p>
However, if we look further back in time, it is not that simple.
You had two distinct parents, and probably 4 distinct grandparents and 8 distinct great-grandparents.
It seems that N generations back, you had 2<sup>N</sup> ancestors.
But the branches of your ancestor tree start to merge as we look further back in time.
Ten generations back, you probably didn&rsquo;t have 2<sup>10</sup> distinct ancestors.
One hundred generations back, you certainly didn&rsquo;t have 2<sup>100</sup> distinct ancestors, because that is vastly more people than have ever existed.
Two people can inherit the same allele from a common ancestor down different pathways of descent.
</p>

<p>
For example, suppose that you and your sister both inherited one copy of the sickle-cell allele of the β-globin gene, but your sister inherited her copy from your father, while you inherited your copy from your mother.
Your mother and father both inherited that allele from a common ancestor six generations back.
The information of both copies came from the same mutation thousands of years ago, and it came from a common ancestor who lived about 200 years ago, but it arrived in you and your sister by different pathways.
Are those instances of the allele &ldquo;identical by descent&rdquo; or not?
</p>

<p>
So, it&rsquo;s not really clear what &ldquo;relatedness&rdquo; means.
However it is defined, it is not the probability that alleles are identical.
It could approximate that in special cases, such as a recent mutation.
It could also be an approximate lower bound on the probability that alleles are shared.
&#x2013; T. K. Van Allen, Selected to be Numerous?, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPXJ85W7">Debunking the Selfish Gene</a></i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Genetic similarity is a more meaningful concept than &ldquo;relatedness&rdquo;, but there&rsquo;s multiple ways to measure it:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Genetic similarity is some metric of shared genetic information.
There are various ways it could be measured.
One is the percentage of identical alleles.
Another is the percentage of coding DNA that is identical.
It could even be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">Hamming distance</a> between nucleotide sequences.
Regardless of how it is defined, it should not be confused with relatedness.
You are 0.5 related to your brother or sister by the simple definition of &ldquo;relatedness&rdquo;, but you share more than 50% of your genetic information with them.
You share most of it with any other human being, and a significant percentage of it with an oyster or an oak tree.
&#x2013; T. K. Van Allen, Selected to be Numerous?, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPXJ85W7">Debunking the Selfish Gene</a></i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
When comparing strands of DNA, biologists have to choose the size of the strand, which influences the measure of genetic similarity.
Compare two random, unrelated people: if we consider strands the size of whole chromosomes, the genetic similarity will be 0% (because no strand is fully identical to another).
The smaller the snippets, the higher the likelihood of two strands being identical, and so the measure of genetic similarity will go up.
Hypothetically, you could compare the base pairs between two organisms one-to-one.
But then you&rsquo;d run into problems because people don&rsquo;t have the exact same amount of base pairs either.
Bits get added, deleted, duplicated, recombined etc.
It&rsquo;s even more of a problem when comparing between species, because different species typically don&rsquo;t even have the same number of chromosomes.
That&rsquo;s why measuring genetic similarity is difficult and involves some assumptions.
As far as I know, biologists use genes as a base for the size of the strands, but they are very variable in size.
Regardless, the resulting measures of genetic similarity give a fairly good idea of how differentiated two populations are.
</p>

<img src="../images/percentage-of-shared-DNA-humans-and-species.jpg" alt="The genetics between Africans and Europeans differs by a total of 0.5%." width="500">

</figure>

<p>
By most metrics, genetic similarity is &gt;99% for all humans, and genetic similarity between humans and chimpanzees (or bonobos) is ~98.8%.
People who are from the same race will be more genetically similar to each other than to people from other races.
And that is true regardless of whichever (reliable) metric we use for measuring genetic similarity.
Since humans and other animals have millions of genes, small changes in the percentage of genetic similarity can lead to big changes, even if the organisms or species share a huge amount of genetic information between each other.

<li>Most WNs believe in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Jewish_conspiracy">Jewish Conspiracy Theory</a>.

<li>White nationalists believe that race differences in crime and IQ are due to genes (genetic determinism), but they also believe that white people are completely controlled by Jewish propaganda. So they also believe in a very strong form of cultural determinism too, which is a contradiction.</li>
<li>Many WNs deny the Holocaust. My position is that the Holocaust was real and the forced labor camps certainly existed, but it&rsquo;s reasonable to be skeptical of the 6 million deaths figure and some other aspects. Regardless, I very strongly condemn the Holocaust.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup> We should also acknowledge that the Holocaust has become <a href="../epistemology/representationalism#meaningless-of-standpoint-theory">a sacred narrative for justifying arbitrary morals</a>.

<li>Many WNs are white supremacists who support a form of race idealism. <a href="#races-better-than-others">I oppose racial supremacy on a philosophical basis</a>, and am better described as a race realist, not a race idealist.</li>

<li>White nationalists tend to oppose having a globalist government, whereas <a href="../civilization/political-philosophy#objections-to-global-government">I&rsquo;ve never seen a principled argument against global governments</a> that doesn&rsquo;t also apply to lower levels of government.

<li>Some WNs argue that the United States and other Western countries don&rsquo;t need high-IQ non-white immigrants.
For example, <a href="https://thuletide.wordpress.com/2023/07/03/mass-deportation-is-economically-sound-logistically-feasible-and-could-be-accomplished-in-a-matter-of-years/">Thuletide stated</a> that the US alone contains ~4.5 million Whites with an IQ over 130, which he probably computed using a normal IQ distribution for European Americans.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I believe that it would be a huge mistake to not accept any high-IQ immigrants from other races.
Immigrants from foreign countries make up the majority of the US STEM workforce.</li>
<li>The labor supply of European Americans with IQs over 130 would also be smaller if women are excluded from working in occupations that require high intelligence. I&rsquo;m noting this because many WNs believe in strict gender roles.</li>
<li>While I believe that <a href="../civilization/technology">a lot of technology is overused</a> these days, it&rsquo;s clear that the US would probably become economically poorer and less intelligent without selective foreign immigration.</li>

Perhaps the most common misconception about ethnostates is that they require killing every non-White person, gassing Jews, and/or requiring 100% of the population to be descended from the ethnostates&rsquo; ethnicities.
This is not true at all.
<a href="https://thuletide.wordpress.com/2022/12/30/the-one-drop-rule-is-it-a-good-idea-spoiler-no/">Even the most practical white nationalists recognize that the one-drop rule is not a useful guideline for ethnostates</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Oxford Dictionary defines &ldquo;ethnostate&rdquo; as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A sovereign state of which citizenship is restricted to members of a particular racial or ethnic group.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/ethnostate">Dictionary.com defines <i>ethnostate</i> as follows</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A country populated by, or dominated by the interests of, a single racial or ethnic group.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ethnostate">Wiktionary.com defines <i>ethnostate</i> as follows</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A political unit that is populated by and run in the interest of an ethnic group.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As we can see from these definitions, an ethnostate is just a state that exists for the interests of one group.
For example, &gt;98% of the people in Japan belong to the Yamato ethnic group, and the state serves the interests of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato_people">Yamato people</a>.
So Japan is an &ldquo;ethnostate&rdquo;, but the state doesn&rsquo;t harm every non-Japanese person.
White nationalists just want ethnostates for White people.
</p>

<p>
It really is that simple.
And many ethnostates already exist all over the world for other ethnic groups (China, Korea, Cambodia, Israel, Somalia, etc), so what&rsquo;s wrong with having some white ethnostates too? Every other major ethnic group already has their own ethnostates, so it&rsquo;s only fair.
</p>


<p>
Another common misconception is that white preservationism, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism">white nationalism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy">white supremacism</a> are all the same thing, but they are not.
Personally, I hate white supremacists, as well as everybody else who is absolutely obsessed with thinking that race is everything (that includes most leftists as well).
<a href="#social-stability">Racial homogeneity would be helpful to any society that has it</a>, but it&rsquo;s not worth obsessing over.
As for White Preservationism, I define it as: A movement to counter the <a href="#great-replacement">Great Replacement</a> by increasing white fertility rates in the Western World.
To me, the goal of white preservationism should be to preserve (most of) the (good) genes of Europeans, not necessarily to preserve distinctively European appearances or to preserve white people as a distinctive race, although I&rsquo;m not against that.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-ethnostates-limitations">
<p>
In the West, white nationalists and eugenicists both agree that reducing mass immigration, deporting illegal aliens, and removing welfare benefits are important priorities.
<a href="https://thuletide.wordpress.com/2023/07/03/mass-deportation-is-economically-sound-logistically-feasible-and-could-be-accomplished-in-a-matter-of-years/">It could be done strategically</a> if there&rsquo;s enough political will and power to make it happen.
There is no debate that <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#social-stability">racially homogenous societies tend to perform better than multiracial societies</a>.
The main disagreements between WNs and race-blind eugenicists are 1. how practical it would be for Western governments to prioritize benefiting the dominant ethnic group over the minority ethnic groups, 2. whether or not that&rsquo;s feasible according to the size of the minority population, and 3. race-mixing should be forbidden.
The white nationalists&rsquo; main justifications are that: 1. it would take too long for minorities to assimilate into the society, 2. <a href="#logistics-for-creating-ethnostates">it can happen if there&rsquo;s enough political will to do it</a>, and 3. race-mixing would be dysgenic and culturally unstable in most cases.
</p>

<p>
The US, the UK, Canada, France, and other Western countries all should&rsquo;ve became ethnostates that greatly curtailed foreign immigration in the 90s, but I am skeptical that it will be possible to reverse the mass immigration from previous decades in the 2020s and beyond.
Non-white people make up too much of the US and Canadian populations<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup> (<a href="../civilization/social-justice#equal-representation">they might have too much leverage</a>), there isn&rsquo;t enough mass public support and political authority to greatly curtail mass immigration from foreign countries, and there&rsquo;s not even enough support among white people for turning those countries into ethnostates.
Bringing up the proposal to turn Western countries into white ethnostates would ignite strong opposition and accusations of racism, and <a href="../epistemology/difficult-to-change-minds">it is difficult to substantially change any person&rsquo;s worldview on just about anything</a>.
For the United States, a more likely scenario is that some region of the US becomes a de facto ethnostate for white people.
Assimilating minorities into the society may take generations, but it&rsquo;s not impossible, especially if EPC limits their population growth.
Whether <a href="#race-mixing">race-mixing is dysgenic and harmful to the civilization is a more complicated issue</a>.
</p>

<p>
The greatest problem facing the West is mass immigration from other countries.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6nG7RloYf0">Reducing foreign immigration</a> would greatly curtail social justice, anti-Western hatred, and the cost of rent, while boosting wages, fertility rates, and eugenics.
This is a smaller goal than achieving a white ethnostate with wider public appeal, so it&rsquo;s more feasible.
We will have greater success at reducing immigration if we focus on emphasizing all the problems that it&rsquo;s causing.
Ethnostates would help achieve white preservationism, but the most important thing is that the fertility rates of white people are increased in general.
Reducing foreign immigration will help with this.
</p>

<p>
There&rsquo;s not much that an ethnostate can do that can&rsquo;t already be solved by a eugenostate.
The biggest problem that ethnonationalist policies won&rsquo;t solve by themselves is preventing overpopulation.
<a href="../FAQs/overpopulation-FAQs#overpop-free-rider-problem">Overpopulation is a free-rider problem</a>, so population control is the only way to conceivably prevent overpopulation without war, disease, or famine.
Ethnostates don&rsquo;t prevent dysgenics by themselves either since they don&rsquo;t regulate reproduction.
Every successful ethnostate would have to <a href="../FAQs/eugenics-FAQs#why-implement-eugenics">enforce EPC</a> in order for it to be sustainable for the long-term future.
Over time, eugenic policies could cause the average black or white person to be as intelligent as East Asians are today, with even lower crime rates too.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-logistics-for-creating-ethnostates">
<p>
Theoretically, these are the most likely steps for converting Western countries into white ethnostates:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>White identity and support for pro-white policies gradually increase over the years as white people continue to be marginalized and discriminated against.</li>
<li>Westerners (especially White Westerners) start to vote more conservatively than they already do.</li>
<li>Western countries eliminate their welfare for immigrants. In the US, eliminating welfare could disincentivize <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230519195024/https://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/02/report-more-than-half-of-immigrants-on-welfare">over 50% of immigrants from staying</a>.</li>
<li>Some immigrants leave Western countries once the welfare stops. If they riot in response to the elimination of welfare, then they are deported. Political support for deporting them would be in response to their rioting and violence. Hard-working immigrants who support the country can (and should) stay.</li>
<li>The public gains enough support for stopping mass immigration, since it increases the cost of rent, and reduces wages, fertility rates, and eugenics.</li>
<li>The Conservatives amass enough popular support for deporting the rest of the illegal aliens from Western countries (there are over 10 million illegal aliens in the United States alone).</li>
<li>As wages rise, white fertility rates increase. The West implements <a href="../FAQs/overpopulation-FAQs#boosting-western-fertility">other measures for boosting white fertility rates</a>.</li>
<li>Western countries reach <a href="../civilization/social-justice#equal-representation">the critical demographics and political thresholds</a> for becoming white ethnostates.</li>
<li>The public gains enough support for <a href="../FAQs/eugenics-FAQs#reproduction-license-reqs">EPC to turn the country into a eugenostate</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that this is an (overly) optimistic timeline.
I&rsquo;m not convinced that the West could achieve even half of the objectives on this list in the future, but we should try to accomplish whatever we can.
All Western countries used to be white ethnostates, and it may be possible to restore that.

<h3 id="global-race"><span class="section-number-3">9.3.</span> Is miscegnation into a &ldquo;global race&rdquo; inevitable?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-global-race">
<p>
To an extent, the notion of &ldquo;mixing&rdquo; is somewhat misleading, because <a href="#continuum-cline-fallacy">there aren&rsquo;t separate discrete types</a> that are being &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; together.
Rather, existing racial clusters can disappear and/or change, due to different selective pressures and global migration.
In that sense, some level of &ldquo;mixing&rdquo; is always inevitable, since genes are always mixed when a male and female mate and conceive a child.
</p>

<p>
Globalization and race-mixing are causing many distinctive racial differences to disappear.
If countries decide to enforce very strict immigration/miscegnation/etc laws, then many distinct races will be mostly preserved as the original genetic clusters that they were historically.
If there&rsquo;s enough political will to prevent race-mixing, then it could theoretically be prevented.
Until then, global immigration, and interracial relationships will continue to blur the boundaries between genetic clusters.
But this doesn&rsquo;t imply that racial categories won&rsquo;t <a href="#race-is-biological-examples">still be useful for having predictive power</a>.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-great-replacement">
<p>
No, not at all.
Anybody who claims the Great Replacement is a myth is a liar, and I say that as someone who is less European than the average American (as of 2024).
</p>

<p>
The Great Replacement is <i>not</i> a theory nor a hypothesis.
It&rsquo;s an observation and a chrononym, on the same level as &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death">The Great Plague</a>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression">The Great Depression</a>&rdquo;, or <a href="../civilization/climate-change">Climate Change</a>.
</p>

<p>
Statistics consistently show that countries with indigenous and/or historically European populations are gradually being replaced by non-European people.
This trend has been happening for decades.
People can pretend that this isn&rsquo;t a problem or that it won&rsquo;t lead to the perishing of white people all they want, but it is undeniable that if the trend continues for several decades, white people will be replaced by other races by and large, unless something happens to reverse the trend and increase the fertility levels of white people within their own indigenous and historical countries.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A report by the U.S. Census Bureau projects a decrease in the ratio of Whites between 2010 and 2050, from 79.5% to 74.0%.
At the same time, Non-Hispanic Whites are projected to no longer make up a majority of the population by 2045, but will remain the largest single ethnic group.
In 2050 they will compose 46.3% of the population.
Non-Hispanic whites made up 85% of the population in 1960.
However, white Americans overall are still projected to make up over 70% of the population in 2050.&rdquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States#Projections">Source</a>

</figure>

<p>
The evidence clearly shows that white people have relatively low fertility compared to other races in Western countries (mass immigration doesn&rsquo;t help with that either), that the population of mixed-race people is on the rise in the West, and if the fertility rates of white people don&rsquo;t increase, then they will get replaced by humans with different genetics.
If the United States does not enforce stricter immigration policies soon, it is on course to become akin to Brazil racially and like South Africa politically.
</p>


<p>
There are no other countries in the world, besides Western ones that import foreigners in great numbers and then indoctrinates them to hate and resent the host population.
People who deny the Great Replacement Theory are following the typical leftist tactic of denying that something bad is happening, but if it is happening, then it&rsquo;s actually a &ldquo;good&rdquo; thing.

<div class="opponent" id="org3ecdfba">
<p>
The percentage of white people in the US and other Western countries may have gone down, but the raw number of white people has gone up.
Whites made up 75.1% of the total US population in 2000, and 72.4% in 2010.
This is not a decrease in population because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220108163720/http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf">the overall number of whites actually rose from 211,460,626 to 223,553,265</a>.
</p>

</div>
<p>
First, that statistic doesn&rsquo;t specify who gets counted as being &ldquo;white&rdquo;.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Do Arabs count as white? Most Arabs consider themselves to be separate from White Europeans.</li>
<li><a href="https://thuletide.wordpress.com/2021/11/20/infographic-are-jews-white-european-spoiler-no/">Do Jewish people count as white</a>?
<a href="https://thuletide.wordpress.com/2021/01/03/are-ashkenazi-jews-white-european/">What about Ashkenazi Jews specifically</a>?</li>
<li>Do Middle Easterners and Central Asians count as white?</li>
<li>If the average black American has ~24% of their genes originating from white people and they make up ~13% of the population, should that fraction of the 13% count as white?</li>
<li>Do mixed-race people count as white, or only the percentage of their genetics that can count as white?</li>
<li>Do white Hispanics count as white? <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4289685/bin/mmc1.pdf">In a 2015 study</a>, the average European admixture among self-identified White Hispanic and Latino Americans is 73%.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Most censuses would classify Arabs, Jews, Middle Easterners, white Hispanics, and people who identify as being white as &ldquo;white&rdquo;.
Given that Hispanics were/are one of the fastest growing ethnic groups in the US during the early 21st century, it&rsquo;s doubtful that the number of wholly European-descended Americans has increased.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
Furthermore, even if it&rsquo;s true that non-mixed-race European Americans went up in overall numbers, the decline in the percentage of the white population still matters for multiple reasons:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It reflects a changing balance of power between whites and minorities, who tend to lean conservative and leftist respectively.</li>
<li>Even if the number of white people in the US and the West increases, white people are still projected to become minorities within historically white countries, an unprecedented phenomenon.</li>
<li>The increase in the non-white population is related to the increase in foreign immigration, which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6nG7RloYf0">should be opposed for multiple reasons</a>.</li>
<li>Purely white people may continue to exist in the future, but if they do, it&rsquo;s quite possible that they could eventually become as rare as whites in South Africa, or as uncommon as American Indians are in the United States.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p>
Additionally, older generations are more white than younger generations.
It may take a few decades or so, but once the West&rsquo;s older and more white population eventually dies off, we&rsquo;ll see that the raw number of white people in the West will go down, not just the percentage of white people.
This is inevitable when the youngest generations are the most racially diverse generations in history, and when future generations are only projected to become less and less white.
<a href="https://eternalanglo.com/fertility-map-united-states">White people have lower fertility rates than non-whites</a>.
</p>

<hr>
<div class="opponent" id="org9668b04">
<p>
Many countries in Europe, especially Eastern Europe, remain ethnically and culturally homogeneous.
</p>

</div>
<p>
We&rsquo;re not arguing that white people are disappearing in <i>every</i> country.
The point is that both the numbers and percentages of white people are projected to decrease in historically white countries like the US, Canada, Australia, and most of Western Europe.
</p>

<hr>
<div class="opponent" id="org7bb0dee">
<p>
How can Great Replacement theory be true when political conservatives tend to have higher birth rates than political liberals?
</p>

</div>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Political conservatives still have below-replacement fertility.</li>
<li>Mass immigration will cause their numbers to continue declining.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Japan and South Korea might have even worse birthrates than Europe, but they do not have the same levels of foreign immigration.
In a hundred years, Japan and South Korea might have only 10% their current populations, but they will still be populated mostly by Japanese and Koreans.
This is not the case in Europe.
In a hundred years, Europe will be mostly Muslim, and a large percentage will not have European ancestry.

I&rsquo;m still half-white (technically I&rsquo;m slightly more than 50% white due to my Y-chromosome and mtDNA).
More importantly, the immigration policies set by Western governments <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6nG7RloYf0">are not aligned with the people of the West</a>.
I care about stopping the Great Replacement because white people were the ones who built the modern world, and I don&rsquo;t want them to die out.
I support turning Western countries into white ethnostates because <a href="#race-mixing-final-thoughts">I&rsquo;ve concluded that ethnostates are more stable societies</a> and I want modern civilization to continue prospering.

<h2 id="glossary"><span class="section-number-2">11.</span> Glossary</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-glossary">
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Evolution</dt><dd>The change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. Evolution is a three-step process consisting of: 1. Reproduction (to excess), 2. Variation (caused by mutations) in offspring, 3. Selection.</dd>
<dt>Biological Realism</dt><dd>The unbiased application of the implications of evolutionary reasoning onto human beings, regarding race, sex, selfishness, eugenics/dysgenics, and intrinsic violence.</dd>
<dt>Biological Determinism</dt><dd>The theory that many traits, abilities, and much of human behavior are determined primarily (or even exclusively) by biological and hereditary factors, such as genetics, hormones, and evolutionary influences.</dd>
<dt>Race Realism</dt><dd>See: <a href="#what-is-race">What is Race Realism?</a>.</dd>
<dt>Scientific Racism</dt><dd>A pejorative term for &ldquo;race realism&rdquo; that misrepresents what it actually is. This term is intended to suggest that the belief is motivated by racism and justified by &ldquo;pseudo-science&rdquo;. <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#not-racists">Race Realism does not imply racism</a>.</dd>
<dt>&ldquo;Human Bio-Diversity&rdquo; (HBD)</dt><dd>Another term that generally means &ldquo;race realism&rdquo;, but can be extended to also talk about other things like sexual differences and such. It seems that HBD may have fewer stigmas or negative connotations than either &ldquo;Race Realism&rdquo; or &ldquo;Scientific Racism&rdquo;.</dd>
<dt>The Hereditarian Hypothesis</dt><dd>The hypothesis that genetics determines most human traits and differences. Another term that is related to and/or refers to &ldquo;race realism&rdquo;.</dd>
<dt>Race</dt><dd>A statistical cluster of genetic variation characterized by phenotypic similarity. Races are useful statistical categories for describing biological characteristics in humans.</dd>
<dt>Statistical Cluster</dt><dd>A grouping of a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). For more info, see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis">Wikipedia: Cluster Analysis</a>.</dd>
<dt>Mixed-Race</dt><dd>Having genes and ancestry from multiple different races. Note that being Mixed-Race cannot be well-defined unless two or more races are defined beforehand.</dd>
<dt>Ethnicity / Ethnic Group</dt><dd>A grouping of people who identify with each other on the basis of shared attributes that distinguish them from other groups. Those attributes can include common sets of traditions, ancestry, language, history, society, culture, nation, religion, or social treatment within their residing area.</dd>
<dt>Racism</dt><dd><a href="https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/what-is-a-racist">There are multiple definitions for &ldquo;racism&rdquo;</a>, since the term doesn&rsquo;t have a clear meaning. I personally prefer the following definition: Irrational prejudice or <a href="../civilization/social-justice#nature-of-discrimination">discrimination</a> based on race or ethnicity.</dd>
<dt>The West</dt><dd>Countries that have majority European populations and/or have been influenced by Western Culture, including Europe, the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. Sometimes I use this term more generally to also include Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore since those countries have also been influenced by Western culture, and have decent genetics for modernity, as far as our policy objectives are concerned.</dd>
<dt>Westernized</dt><dd>Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and other countries that have been significantly influenced by Western culture. These countries also have similar values to Western countries and decent genetics for modernity, as far as our policy objectives are concerned.</dd>
<dt>The Great Replacement (of White People)</dt><dd>The phenomenon where white people are being replaced by foreign ethnicities within Western countries. It is very real and in several decades, it is projected to be finished by the end of the 21st century.</dd>
<dt>White Preservationism</dt><dd>A movement to counter the Great Replacement by increasing white fertility rates in the Western World. From a eugenics standpoint, the goal of white preservationism is to preserve (most of) the (good) genes of Europeans, not necessarily to preserve white people as a distinctive race.</dd>
<dt>White Nationalism</dt><dd>An ideology that promotes ethnostates for white people, perhaps as a way to support white preservationism.</dd>
<dt>White Supremacy</dt><dd>A form of race idealism that values white people.</dd>
<dt>Race Idealism</dt><dd>An ideology that espouses racial superiority, preserving racial composition, and racial solidarity (v1) as its core values. Race idealism is accompanied with racism and selective data and interpretations to affirm its values.</dd>
<dt>Ethnostate (v1)</dt><dd>A country populated by, or dominated by the interests of, a single racial or ethnic group.</dd>
<dt>Ethnostate (v2)</dt><dd>A sovereign state of which citizenship is restricted to members of a particular racial or ethnic group.</dd>
<dt>Ethnostate (v3)</dt><dd>An ethnonationalist state that enforces racial or ethnic homogeneity.</dd>
<dt>Ethnocracy</dt><dd>The same thing as an ethnostate, except there doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be a single ethnic group that populates the majority of the country.</dd>
<dt>Eugenostate</dt><dd>A state that enforces Eugenic Population Control, Laissez-Faire Eugenics, and Immigration restrictions, regardless of race or ethnicity.</dd>
<dt>Race Denialism</dt><dd>The denial of Race Realism, either with fallacies and/or a refusal to extend the implications of evolutionary reasoning onto human beings.</dd>
<dt>Race Creationism</dt><dd>The same thing as Race Denialism, with the connotation that the belief is similar to religious dogma.</dd>
<dt>Racial Solidarity (v1)</dt><dd>Solidarity between all the members of a race with each other. Proponents of racial solidarity tend to believe in kin altruism.</dd>
<dt>Racial Solidarity (v2)</dt><dd>Solidarity between people from different races with each other.</dd>

Many parts of this page&rsquo;s contents were written by other people.
When possible, I&rsquo;ve tried to quote people and give credit to them by displaying their text in block quotes and/or linking to where I first saw the text.
Unfortunately, there are some limitations to doing this due to the formatting, design decisions, <a href="../programming/blogging-with-org-mode#org-mode-for-webpages">the software that I use to create pages on this website</a>, and other factors.
So, I created this section to give credit to people where it is due.
I&rsquo;d like to thank the following people for writing the text that is featured on this FAQs page:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The second paragraph and numbered list argument of <a href="#social-construct">Isn&rsquo;t Race just a social construct?</a> was copy-edited from text displayed in one of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WhatifAltHist/videos">WhatIfAltHist&rsquo;s videos</a>.</li>
<li>Many bullets in <a href="#race-is-biological-examples">Examples of Race Being Biological</a> were paraphrased from <a href="https://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Race_and_morphology/physiology">Race and Morphology/Physiology</a> on Metapedia.</li>
<li>The following sections have paragraphs that were copy-edited from <a href="https://jaymans.wordpress.com/jaymans-race-inheritance-and-iq-f-a-q-f-r-b/">JayMan&rsquo;s Race FAQs/FRBs</a>:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="#continuum-cline-fallacy">But race exists on a continuum, so race does not exist</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#evolution-accelerated-last-50000-years">There can&rsquo;t be racial differences because human evolution stopped 50000+ years ago</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#mental-traits-inheritance">No one has found a gene for intelligence, criminality, or any behavioral trait, so behavioral traits can&rsquo;t be inherited</a>. (The second paragraph was written by myself.)</li>
<li><a href="#IQ-scores">But there&rsquo;s no objective way to define &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; or quantify it with IQ scores</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#intelligence-inheritability">Racial Disparities in Intelligence</a>.</li>
<li><a href="#race-gap-educational-and-economic">Racial Disparities in Economic Status and Academic Achievement</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A paragraph in <a href="#genetic-similarity-relatedness">What is the difference between genetic similarity and relatedness?</a> was copy-edited from <a href="https://brittonicmemetics.wordpress.com/">Felix</a> on Discord.</li>
<li>Some of the paragraphs in <a href="#K-cluster-analysis">K-Cluster Analysis</a> and <a href="#why-race-realism-matters">Why does it matter that people accept that race is biological?</a> were copy-edited from <a href="https://eternalanglo.com/">Anglo Tremilia</a> on Discord.</li>
<li>The numbered list in <a href="#academia">Hasn&rsquo;t Academia debunked race realism as anti-scientific pseudoscience?</a> was <a href="https://thuletide.wordpress.com/2020/12/28/is-there-a-scientific-consensus-on-the-existence-of-human-races/">written by Thuletide</a>.</li>
<li>Some paragraphs in <a href="#occams-razor-on-racial-disparities">Occam&rsquo;s Razor on Racial Disparities</a> were written by Blithering Genius in <i><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/11/response-to-my-ratwiki-entry.html">Response to my RatWiki Entry</a></i>. Some paragraphs in <a href="#race-gap-crime-rates">Racial Disparities in Crime Rates</a> were paraphrased from Blithering Genius on Discord.</li>
<li>Most of the bullets in <a href="#behavioral-differences">Behavioral Differences</a> were copy-edited from JayMan&rsquo;s post <a href="https://jaymans.wordpress.com/2012/07/12/how-much-hard-evidence-do-you-need/">How Much Hard Evidence Do You Need?</a></li>
<li>The bullet list in <a href="#academia">Hasn&rsquo;t Academia debunked race realism as anti-scientific pseudoscience?</a> and paragraphs in <a href="#organ-transplants">Organ Transplants</a> were copy-edited from Thuletide&rsquo;s posts. Also, many links in <a href="#addressing-other-race-fallacies">Addressing Other Race Fallacies</a> link to his website. Many of the unsourced images are from Thuletide&rsquo;s website.</li>
<li>The first paragraph of <a href="#IQ-scores">But there’s no objective way to define &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; or quantify it with IQ scores</a> was paraphrased from <a href="https://gnew.substack.com/">Gnew</a> on Discord.</li>
<li>Some of the arguments in <a href="#intelligence-tradeoffs">Wouldn&rsquo;t high intelligence be adaptive in all environments?</a> were copy-edited from <a href="https://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Arguments_regarding_the_existence_of_races#Evolution_always_maximizes_intelligence.3F">Metapedia&rsquo;s Arguments Regarding the Existence of Races</a>. The hypothesized genetic explanation for the correlation between IQ and myopia was conceived by <a href="https://eternalanglo.com/">Anglo Tremilia</a> on Discord.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Zero Contradictions wrote, compiled, and formatted everything else on this page, and many authors have influenced my thinking.
Overall, I&rsquo;d personally say that <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/p/links.html">Blithering Genius</a> has been the most influential person in shaping the beliefs that I accept and have stated on this page.
</p>

<p>
Disclaimer: I want to be clear that just because I&rsquo;m quoting and citing text written on other websites, that does <i>not</i> mean that I agree with other things that they&rsquo;ve written, even though <a href="../misc/response-to-ratwiki-pragmatosphere-article">some people have falsely accused me of otherwise</a>.
I recognize that Thuletide and Metapedia endorse white supremacy in some of their webpages, but that does <i>not</i> mean that I support white supremacy, hence why I avoided citing anything that they wrote that is biased towards race idealism and racism.
I re-emphasize that <a href="../misc/response-to-ratwiki-pragmatosphere-article#zero-contradictions">I strongly condemn all forms of racism</a>.
Likewise, JayMan has written about many other ideas on his blog besides race realism, and I disagree with most of them (e.g. See: <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/07/re-rise-of-universalism.html">Re: The Rise of Universalism</a> by Blithering Genius).
