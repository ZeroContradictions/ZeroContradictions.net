For the record, I went through a phase in my life where I was passionate about Libertarianism and Anarchism for about four years. As you can imagine, I was as opposed to state mandated population control as any other anarchist what would&rsquo;ve been. Eventually, I later <a href="../journey/case-against-libertarianism.html">rejected Anarchism and Libertarianism</a> when I realized that both ideas were doomed to fail due to biological realities and game-theoretic problems that can <i>only</i> be resolved by government.
</p>

<p>
When I used to be a Libertarian, I was also a fervent believer in Cornucopianism, but I later realized that I was opposed to population control not because it is unnecessary for civilization to continue to prosper in the future, but rather because it would&rsquo;ve negated with my ideology to have to admit that population control is necessary for humanity to have a future, as I thoroughly outline on this comprehensive FAQs page. I encourage all population control skeptics to ask the same question: <i>Are they opposed to population control because it&rsquo;s unnecessary, or because they <b>wished</b> that it were unnecessary?</i>
</p>

<p>
On this site, I have written a detailed blog post about why it is so difficult to change peoples minds, with an epistemic analysis of people&rsquo;s meta-cognition: <a href="../epistemology/difficult-to-change-peoples-minds.html">Why It&rsquo;s So Difficult To Change People&rsquo;s Minds</a> (in progress)
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve been banned from the Geopraxis Discord Server (which I don&rsquo;t recommend joining) for speaking the Truth and pointing out the hypocrisy and double standards of the mods, but the Truth shall not be silenced. The most urgent problems of our times are the ones that cannot be discussed.

</p>

<p>
The Geopraxis Discord Server censored me because they are <b><i>not</i></b> interested in pursuing the Truth. They are delusional and they have confirmation bias. They believe that population control is unnecessary because they <i>wish</i> it were unnecessary, <a href="#if-no-pop-regulation">not because it is unnecessary</a>.

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Overpopulation</dt><dd>See: <a href="#what-is-overpop">What is Overpopulation?</a></dd>
<dt>Malthusianism</dt><dd>The theory that potentially exponential population growth can surpass the linear growth of an environment&rsquo;s carrying capacity (including its food supply and other resources), which eventually causes members of the population to die off until settling back down to the carrying capacity.</dd>
</dl>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Neo-Malthusianism</dt><dd>The theory and concern that overpopulation (and overconsumption) may increase resource depletion and/or environmental degradation and lead to ecological collapse or other hazards. Neo-Malthusianism is often coupled with advocacy of human population planning to ensure sufficient resources for current and future human populations as well as for other species.</dd>
<dt>Cornucopianism</dt><dd>The pseudo-scientific theory that overpopulation, overconsumption, and environmental problems faced by society either do not exist or can be solved by technology and/or the free market.</dd>
<dt>Fertility (v1)</dt><dd>The birthrate of a population; expressed as the number of live births per 1000 people per year.</dd>
<dt>Fertility (v2)</dt><dd>The state of being fertile; capable of producing offspring.</dd>
<dt>Ecological Overshoot</dt><dd>The phenomenon which occurs when the demands made on a natural ecosystem exceed its regenerative capacity. Global ecological overshoot occurs when the demands made by humanity exceed what the biosphere of Earth can provide through its capacity for renewal.</dd>
<dt>Demographic Transition Theory (DTT)</dt><dd>The pseudo-scientific theory that humanity will go through a transition from high fertility to low fertility as their societies modernize. Supposedly this will lead to a stable or declining world population at some point in the future. This theory fits the evidence of recent history, but it will ultimately make the wrong predictions for the future since it relies on fallacious assumptions.</dd>
<dt>Population Control</dt><dd>The practice of preventing the size of a population from growing past the carrying capacity, in the interest of avoiding an Overpopulation Crisis. For humans specifically, population control must be done by either artificially via Birth Control (and immigration restrictions), or naturally via War, Disease, and Famine.</dd>
<dt>Carrying Capacity</dt><dd>The maximum population size of a biological species that can be sustained by that specific environment, given the food, habitat, water, and other resources available.</dd>
<dt>Overpopulation Crisis</dt><dd>When the carrying capacity is so high above the carrying capacity, that War, Disease, and Famine start to occur.</dd>
<dt>War, Disease, and Famine</dt><dd>The main traditional ways how overpopulation have historically been solved in human societies. The vast majority of deaths throughout human history can be attributed to War, Disease, and Famine.</dd>
<dt>Birth Control</dt><dd>The use of methods or devices to prevent unwanted pregnancy. The main force of population control in Modernity. Birth Control is responsible for causing countries all over the world to have below replacement fertility rates, temporarily in the grand scheme of things.</dd>
<dt>Reproduction License</dt><dd>A legal document that affirms that the citizen who possesses the title is legally authorized to have X number of children, given that they meet the legal requirements and have paid for the license.</dd>
<dt>Georgism</dt><dd>An economic philosophy stating that things found in nature, most importantly land, belong equally to all. It is usually associated with the idea of a single tax on the value of land and natural resources. See: <a href="../economics/georgism-elevator-pitch.html">this page for more info</a>.</dd>
<dt>The West</dt><dd>Countries that have majority European populations and/or have been influenced by Western Culture, including Europe, the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. Sometimes I use this term more generally to also include Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan since those countries have also been influenced by Western culture, and have decent genetics for modernity, as far as our policy objectives are concerned.</dd>
<dt>Eugenics</dt><dd>The improvement of genetic qualities through selection, to make people/organisms more adaptive to their relative environments. What is considered &ldquo;Eugenic&rdquo; is always relative to a given environment, but when the term is used, it&rsquo;s usually assumed that the environment in question is Modernity. In simpler words, Eugenics just means selecting for traits that we value in other human beings, traits such as intelligence and responsibility.</dd>
<dt>Dysgenics</dt><dd>The opposite of eugenics. The accumulation of traits that make people/organisms <i>less</i> adaptive to their environments, thus resulting in Evolutionary Mismatch. Dysgenics usually arises when selectionary pressures are removed.</dd>
<dt>Eugenic Population Control (EPC)</dt><dd>Population Control via mandatory Birth Control and (Laissez-Faire) Eugenics via Reproduction Licenses.</dd>
<dt>Population Buffer Space (PBS)</dt><dd>The estimated difference between the Carrying Capacity and the LMPL.</dd>
<dt>Legal Maximum Population Limit (LMPL)</dt><dd>The maximum population limit of the society that the population must avoid exceeding, in the interest of avoiding an Overpopulation Crisis, as set by a eugenostate. The LMPL is always lower than the Carrying Capacity, with the Population Buffer Space being the quantitative difference between them. The LMPL is meant to be a target population the society should stay below, but if the population does rise above it, the Population Buffer Space gives the eugenostate some flexibility, as it still avoids exceeding the Carrying Capacity.</dd>

<h2 id="what-is-overpop"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> What is overpopulation?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what-is-overpop">
<p>
Overpopulation is when there is an excessive number of occupants (people, animals, plants, etc.) in a particular area; specifically, when the number of occupants exceeds the ability of that area to provide for them. Overpopulation is preceded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_overshoot">ecological overshoot</a>.
</p>

<p>
The primary misconception of overpopulation is that it only depends on the number of organisms/people. This view assumes that the only factor that matters for overpopulation is the number of organisms within the environment. It further assumes that, if a certain number of individuals can be supported <i>in the present</i>, there&rsquo;ll be no problems <i>in the future</i>, <a href="#overpop-can-happen-instantly">which I&rsquo;ve debunked here</a>.
</p>

<p>
This view is wrong and very ignorant about biology. Overpopulation is determined by at least four parameters:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Number of creatures (usually of a single species) in an area</li>
<li>An area and its resources</li>
<li>The average ecological footprint per creature (for humans, this is the average standard of living per capita)</li>

To quote from <a href="http://www.justopia.org/overpopulation---malthus-being-wrong-doesnt-make-you-right.html">&ldquo;Malthus Being Wrong Doesn&rsquo;t Make You Right&rdquo;</a> on justopia.org:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
1,000 people living in the fertile crescent isn&rsquo;t overpopulation. 1,000 people living on a 2-acre island would almost certainly be so. An area can support far fewer people living first world lifestyles (50-100 full-time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_slave">energy slaves</a>) than ones living like the typical African bushman.
</p>

<p>
Overpopulation also considers the amount of time a population can be sustained, though one could argue this ties into &ldquo;the resources in an area&rdquo; bullet point. Right now, humans are drawing down oil reserves which have taken millions of years to form. If we&rsquo;re only considering the resources humanity has, 8 billion people can probably be sustained until the energy returned on energy invested from oil becomes nearly 1:1. There may be enough time for humanity to switch to different energy sources like nuclear energy, but it&rsquo;s not guaranteed&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The concept of overshoot requires a time dimension. Given widely known technology, humans are in overshoot now. That means that without finding a new energy source or drastically lowering the ecological footprint per person (AKA having a shittier lifestyle), there is simply <i>not</i> going to be 8 billion humans alive simultaneously within 100 years: the current number of humans on Earth is simply <i>not sustainable</i>. ― Justin D Keith

<h2 id="malthus-was-wrong"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Hasn&rsquo;t Malthusianism been debunked?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-malthus-was-wrong">
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthus">Thomas Malthus</a> is widely regarded as the most famous early intellectual of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_dynamics">population dynamics</a>. In 1798, Malthus wrote &ldquo;An Essay on the Principles of Population&rdquo;, stating:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;Must it not then be acknowledged by an attentive examiner of the histories of mankind, that in every age and in every state in which man has existed, or does now exist:
</p>

<p>
That the increase of population is necessarily limited by the means of subsistence.
</p>

<p>
That population does invariably increase when the means of subsistence increase.
</p>

<p>
And that the superior power of population it repressed, and the actual population kept equal to the means of subsistence, by misery and vice?&ldquo;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Malthus was correct that human populations had historically been limited by subsistence farming (at the time he wrote the essay), but he was wrong that this would always be the case in the future because he didn&rsquo;t correctly anticipate the discovery of additional energy sources, and didn&rsquo;t see the contributions people like Norman Borlaug made through genetically engineering crops. So Malthus&rsquo; thesis about linear production versus exponential consumption rates was incorrect. However, what Malthus&rsquo;s claim in the essay is different from the definition of <b>Malthusianism</b>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Malthusianism</b>: The theory that potentially exponential population growth can surpass the linear growth of an environment&rsquo;s carrying capacity (including its food supply and other resources), which eventually causes members of the population to die off until settling back down to the carrying capacity.
</p>

<p>
<b>Neo-Malthusianism</b>: The theory and concern that overpopulation (and overconsumption) may increase resource depletion and/or environmental degradation and lead to ecological collapse or other hazards. Neo-Malthusianism is often coupled with advocacy of human population planning to ensure sufficient resources for current and future human populations as well as for other species.
</p>

<p>
We are <i>not</i> defending what Malthus wrote in 1798 (that populations are limited by subsistence farming). Instead, <a href="#malthusianism-cornucopniasm">we are arguing in favor of <b>Neo-Malthusianism</b></a>, which is a completely different concept that can be defended by an upgraded knowledge of history, population dynamics, and evolutionary reasoning. It does not follow that Malthus being wrong means that the concepts of overpopulation and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_overshoot">ecological overshoot</a> are incorrect, not applicable to humans, or not a risk which bears investigation. We support well-grounded Neo-Malthusian solutions as a solution to the overpopulation disaster that is bound to plague humanity within the 21st century.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-malthusianism-cornucopniasm">
<p>
The simplest way to disprove Cornucopianism (the opposite of Neo-Malthusianism) is to point out that it is absurd to insist that there can be infinite population growth within a finite environment. It was explained in <a href="#what-is-overpop">this section</a> that Overpopulation depends on much more than just the number of organisms. Of course, Cornucopians will argue that humanity will invent new technologies and better economic policies that expand the carrying capacity, but <a href="#rising-wealth-and-fertility">that arguments has been debunked in this section</a>.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, just because we haven&rsquo;t faced overpopulation yet, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it will never happen. Everything that was thought impossible, but was possible, only seemed impossible until it actually happened. Even though Thomas Malthus&rsquo;s predictions on the world&rsquo;s maximum population have been proven wrong so far ever since the Industrial Revolution began, that doesn&rsquo;t make Cornucopians right because it&rsquo;s equivalent to saying &ldquo;Well I haven&rsquo;t died yet, so I will never die&rdquo;, even though that is absurd. Everybody knows that life cannot live forever, and likewise, everyone ought to know that infinite growth is impossible within a finite environment.

<h3 id="if-no-pop-regulation"><span class="section-number-3">5.1.</span> What will happen if we don&rsquo;t regulate the world population?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-if-no-pop-regulation">
<p>
If we don&rsquo;t regulate reproduction, then we are destined to face the largest most unparalleled overpopulation event in history, which will be accompanied by what will definitely be the largest <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html?view=classic">famines and wars ever seen before in human history</a>.
</p>

<p>
There will be very dire and catastrophic consequences if don&rsquo;t regulate the world population:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Food shortages and associated malnutrition, susceptibility to disease, stunted growth and stunted brain power, and starvation.</li>
<li>Per capital water shortage and poor water quality, dehydration, not enough water for crops, not enough water for freshwater ecosystems, not enough water for industrial use, etc.</li>
<li>Peak oil, which greatly impacts food supply.</li>
<li>Climate change which creates hotter, more hostile crop growing conditions and flooding, also hostile to crops.</li>
<li>Shortage of nonrenewable resources, particularly fertilizer, necessary for crop production, but also other resources needed for manufacturing, without which our materialistic civilization will grind to a halt.</li>
<li>Environmental damage caused by the quest for more fossil fuels and essential metals, destruction of animal habitat caused by urbanization.</li>
<li>Economic strain: Overpopulation can put a strain on a country&rsquo;s economy by increasing the demand for housing, transportation, and other resources. This can lead to inflation, unemployment, and a decrease in living standards.</li>
<li>Social problems: Overpopulation can lead to overcrowding, which can cause a host of social problems, such as increased crime, stress, and mental health issues.</li>
<li>Political instability: Overpopulation can also put a strain on a country&rsquo;s political and social systems, which can lead to social unrest, civil war and other forms of political instability.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Overpopulation is like a runaway train, and the longer we wait to do something about it, the harder it will be to deal with the impacts. It&rsquo;s common sense that we should figure out a way to prevent this doomsday scenario from ever happening while we still can.
</p>

<p>
Going by food shortages alone, it will only get worse unless we quickly stabilize population and find some as-yet-discovered agricultural advancement. The Green Revolution has petered out. Overpopulation causes rural farming people to outgrow their lands, so the grown children move to cities. Urbanization eats up farmland, reducing crop production. Also growing seasons are becoming hotter, so many crops fail due to heat and drought. Overuse of the soils caused by overpopulation leads poor nourishment for crops and eventually desertification. Overpopulation draws on available water to the point that there is not enough to water crops. Aquifers are overdrawn to the point where they are not replenished fast enough.
</p>

<p>
If we want to maintain the modern condition of prosperity in which most children live to adulthood, then we have to <a href="#overpop-solution">socially regulate reproduction</a> in order to maintain a stable population and a <a href="../FAQs/EPC-FAQs.html">stable or improving genome</a>. Otherwise, population growth and <a href="../FAQs/EPC-FAQs.html#evidence-of-increasing-dysgenics">dysgenics</a> are guaranteed to bring about the <a href="#next-overpop-crisis">collapse of modern civilization</a>. If that happens, we will return to the Malthusian condition in which the <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html?view=classic">human population is limited by premature death</a>. Those are the only possible destinies for humanity. We can still collectively choose one or the other, but time is running out.

Slowing population growth takes time unless we resort to drastic, ugly, highly unpopular solutions. We must increase funding for family planning now, because putting babies back in the womb, or even a worse alternative, is not an acceptable solution.

<p>
Even if someone is not convinced by the arguments made against Cornucopianism on this FAQs page, the problem with the &ldquo;time will tell&rdquo; attitude towards overpopulation is that it assumes that it&rsquo;s okay to risk overpopulation happening and all the serious consequences that will result from that. That is insane. Who on Earth thinks that it&rsquo;s a good idea to risk the possibility of billions of people dying from war and famine just to test if Neo-Malthusianism is a legitimate concern?

<h3 id="overpop-can-happen-instantly"><span class="section-number-3">5.3.</span> Overpopulation can happen instantly and unpredictably.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-overpop-can-happen-instantly">
<p>
Most people don&rsquo;t realize that it&rsquo;s possible for overpopulation to happen both instantly and unpredictably if a major catastrophe happens, just like the Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849). Once the potato was introduced to Ireland, the country had a population explosion since the crop increased the number of available calories and nutrition to the population.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wViBPPjEdD8">Real Life Lore Video: Why Ireland Has Fewer People Than 200 Years Ago</a>
</p>

<p>
Nobody would&rsquo;ve predicted in 1843 or 1844 that the island would be infected with a blight within the next year that would cause a massive famine where a million people die and another million have to emigrate. One year, the island was not overpopulated because it had enough resources for everybody. The next year, it was facing famine and mass exodus. That&rsquo;s how quickly overpopulation could potentially happen, if the catastrophe causing it is severe enough.
</p>

<p>
It is true that government policies like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_Laws">Corn Laws</a> were partially responsible for the Irish Potato Famine. But even if political changes and factors could have been made to mitigate the effects of the famine, it&rsquo;s still possible for another catastrophe to happen that cannot be resolved by better policies and efforts, especially since it will be happening on a <i>global</i> scale the next time it happens. To believe otherwise is wishful thinking and irrational.
</p>

<p>
The key to causing overpopulation to have improved <a href="#rising-wealth-and-fertility">living standards (i.e. a new staple crop or technology that causes a population boom)</a>, followed by some event which disables the stimuli / resources that were responsible for the population boom. Although the population growth leading up to an overpopulation event might happen gradually, the catastrophe that leads to the overpopulation can happen instantly and unpredictably. All it takes is a major and/or unprecendented catastrophe, and everything changes. Since it&rsquo;s always possible for an unpredictable colossal catastrophe to cause instant overpopulation, that means that ideally we should <b>always</b> be prepared against a potential overpopulation crisis.
</p>

<p>
Besides the Irish Potato Famine, there have been several other historical examples of overpopulation, such as:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ancient Rome: The population of Rome grew rapidly in the first century AD, and by the second century AD, the city had a population of over one million people. The city struggled to provide housing, food, and clean water for its citizens, which led to overcrowding, disease, and poverty.</li>
<li>Medieval Europe: During the medieval period, Europe experienced overpopulation as a result of an increase in food production due to advancements in agriculture. This led to issues such as land scarcity, deforestation, and soil erosion, until the Black Death occurred.</li>
<li>The Ming and Qing dynasties in China: The Ming and Qing dynasties in China experienced overpopulation as a result of a population boom and a lack of resources to support the growing population. This led to issues such as land scarcity, food shortages, and environmental degradation.</li>
<li>Ancient Mesopotamia: The civilizations of ancient Mesopotamia, such as Sumer and Akkad, experienced overpopulation as a result of their success in developing irrigation systems to farm the fertile land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. This led to issues such as soil degradation, deforestation, and a dependence on a single food source.</li>
<li>Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica: The civilizations of pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, such as the Maya, experienced overpopulation as a result of their success in developing advanced agricultural systems. This led to issues such as land scarcity, deforestation, and soil erosion.</li>
<li>The Indus Valley Civilization: The Indus Valley Civilization experienced overpopulation as a result of their success in developing advanced agricultural systems. This led to issues such as land scarcity, deforestation, and soil erosion.</li>
<li>Bangladesh: Bangladesh is an example of a country that is currently facing the consequences of overpopulation. The country has a population density of more than 1,100 people per square kilometer, and limited resources have led to overcrowding, poverty, and environmental degradation.</li>

<h3 id="countries-with-declining-populations"><span class="section-number-3">6.1.</span> Don&rsquo;t countries with declining populations like Japan or Russia prove that human populations aren&rsquo;t bound to increase towards infinity?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-countries-with-declining-populations">
<p>
To answer the question: no.
</p>

<p>
Our theory of population dynamics has a better, alternative explanation for why some countries&rsquo; populations are not currently rising towards infinity that is consistent with our claim that all populations <i>eventually</i> increase towards infinity. Russia, Japan, and other countries are experiencing declining populations because <i>every</i> population of organisms goes down when a new selectionary pressure (birth control and expensive post-industrial cost of living, in this case) is introduced that the population is very unadapted to. <a href="#evolve-to-resist-birth-control">As soon as enough selection occurs to make the population well adapted to its new environment</a> (i.e. organisms with higher fertility rates<sup><a id="fnr.1.100" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> are selected for), the populations will rise until they breach the carrying capacity once more. We just have to wait for evolution to catch up. Evolution doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight. Neither does advanced technology cause evolution to stop.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, one of the biggest reasons why many contemporary countries have extremely low birth rates (and thus declining populations) in the first place is because it&rsquo;s simply too expensive for many couples for children. As we have shown <a href="#rising-wealth-and-fertility">here<sub>1</sub></a> and <a href="#stats-more-wealth-more-children">here<sub>2</sub></a>, if economic conditions were to improve, then birth rates would increase because more people would be able to afford to have (more) children.

<div id="outline-container-rising-living-standards-and-overpop" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="rising-living-standards-and-overpop"><span class="section-number-3">6.2.</span> Won&rsquo;t rising living standards solve overpopulation?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-rising-living-standards-and-overpop">
<p>
Raising living standards would make overpopulation <i>worse</i>, not better. Raising living standards in developing countries might (temporarily) slow down the population growth of those countries <a href="#wealth-and-fertility-rates-correlation">for the reasons stated in this section</a>, but believing that raising standards could solve overpopulation completely ignores that societies with higher living standards require more resources and are more taxing on the environment, thus increasing the risk for overpopulation. Once again, <a href="#what-is-overpop">overpopulation depends on much more than than the number of humans</a>. Most of the world currently does <i>not</i> live a first-world lifestyle, and if all of the 8+ billion people living on Earth were to eventually start living that such an environmentally taxing lifestyle today, we would undoubtedly be facing overpopulation and ever-exacerbated climate change as soon as that happens. Even if the population were to stop growing, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that overpopulation ceases to be a threat.
</p>

<p>
Rising living standards would also cause people to live longer lives, which would also contribute to overpopulation by causing more people to be living on the planet simultaneously.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-rising-wealth-and-fertility">
<p>
No. Not only would raising living standards exacerbate overpopulation by increasing resource consumption, but it&rsquo;s not even true that raising living standards could <i>permanently</i> cause populations to grow slower or stop growing entirely. It doesn&rsquo;t make <i>any</i> sense at all to believe that birth rates drop when the living standards of the amount of wealth of a society increase. Abundant food would cause population <b>growth</b>, <i>not</i> population stability or decline. An expansion of the food supply causes population growth for every other species. There is no reason why human beings should be exempt from this general principle.
</p>

<p>
The idea that wealth causes decreased fertility<sup><a id="fnr.1.100" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> is not consistent with the evidence of history at all. If anything, increased wealth would lead to increased resources, which in turn leads to increased birth rates. There are countless historical examples where improved living standards caused an <i>increase</i> in human fertility, <i>not</i> a decrease, including but not limited to:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution">The Neolithic Agricultural Revolution</a>: The development of agriculture around 10,000 years ago led to a significant increase in food production, which in turn led to a population boom.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbian_exchange#Effects">The Columbian Exchange</a>: The introduction of corn, potatoes, and other crops to the Old World caused populations to increase around the World, and is responsible for most of the world&rsquo;s population growth between 1500 and 1804, when the world population is estimated to have reached 1 billion people for the first time in human history. This includes the rapid increase of the Irish population after the introduction of potatoes to Ireland.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_colonization_of_the_Americas#List_of_European_colonies_in_the_Americas">The Colonization and Settlement of the Old World</a>: French and English settlers in the Americas adapted to conditions of abundance by increasing their fertility. Women married younger and had more children, and the population of Europeans in the Americas expanded rapidly. Until fairly recently, families with 10 or more children were common in Quebec.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution">The Industrial Revolution</a>: The Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries led to increased wealth, improved living conditions, and a rise in life expectancy, resulting in a population boom. The greatest economic revolution in history led to the largest population boom in history.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution">The Green Revolution</a>: The Green Revolution of the 20th century led to an increase in food production through the use of new technologies such as pesticides, fertilizers, and irrigation, which in turn led to a population boom in many developing countries.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression#Role_of_women_and_household_economics">The Great Depression</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-20th_century_baby_boom">Post-World War II Baby Boom</a>: Birthrates dropped during the Great Depression due to the poor economic conditions. After World War II, many countries experienced a period of economic prosperity and increased wealth, which led to a significant increase in population.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy#/media/File:Birth_rate_in_China.svg">The Effects of China&rsquo;s Economy on Its Birth Rates</a>: China&rsquo;s birth rates dropped significantly during the Great Chinese Famine from 1959 to 1961, and the birth rates more than doubled when the famine ended and economic conditions improved. Note that China definitely would have had a population boom during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_economic_reform">Chinese Economic Miracle</a>, if it weren&rsquo;t for the implementation of the One Child Policy in 1980. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy#/media/File:Birth_rate_in_China.svg">Source</a></li>
<li>Even though there was a general decline in fertility across the developed world in the 20th century, fertility rates fell faster and went lower in the Communist Soviet Union than they did in the much wealthier United States.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In the 21st century, <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.36.1.151">the Great Recession</a> caused birthrates to fall.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The historical evidence consistently shows that increased wealth leads to increased fertility rates, and poorer economic conditions or decreased wealth lead to lower fertility rates. It is absolutely absurd to insist otherwise. The real reason why the increased wealth of modern currently correlates with decreased fertility rates <a href="#wealth-and-fertility-rates-correlation">is explained in this section</a>.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-stats-more-wealth-more-children">
<p>
It is true that poorer people tend to have higher birth rates, and that wealthier people tend to have lower birth rates. However, those correlations don&rsquo;t take into account how it&rsquo;s more likely that low fertility and decisions associated with lower fertility (e.g. higher education levels, stronger commitment to the labor force, a preference to live in urban locations, etc) cause higher incomes, rather than the other way around. Fortunately though, <a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/how-income-affects-fertility">there are studies</a> where these other factors have been isolated, so that we can analyze how only income and wealth affects fertility rates:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One study found that a <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/REST_a_00257">10% increase in income resulted in an 8% increase in birth rates</a>.</li>
<li>Another study found that <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/REST_a_00266">a $100,000 increase in the value of one’s home results in a 16% increase in the probability of having a child</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Other studies show that the high cost of child-rearing is in fact, a major reason why child-free people aren&rsquo;t having children. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/11/19/growing-share-of-childless-adults-in-u-s-dont-expect-to-ever-have-children/">According to Pew</a>, 17% of non-parents who want to have children but won&rsquo;t have children have chosen &ldquo;financial reasons&rdquo;. Likewise, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/31/world/asia/china-three-child-policy.html">the high cost of living in China</a> is a major reason why China&rsquo;s birth rates have not rose after the government removed all penalties and restrictions for couples who have multiple children in July 2021. <i>The fact that there are tens of millions of people who want to have more children but cannot afford to contradicts the assumption that improving economic conditions would lower birth rates</i>. This implies that increasing the wealth of society would increase fertility rates by making it possible for people who want to have children but can&rsquo;t afford to under poorer economic conditions. This is perfectly consistent with the historical observation that increased wealth has always resulted in higher fertility rates, not lower fertility rates.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-tech-and-freer-markets">
<p>
Cornucopians greatly overestimate the power of technology. For one thing, technology has had <a href="../journey/philosophy-of-technology.html#problems-caused-by-technology">many negative effects on society, and in many cases, it backfired by making society arguably worse</a>.
</p>

<p>
More importantly, to whatever extent that technological advancement has temporarily raised the Earth&rsquo;s carrying capacity, this ignores that technology has also been fueling a demand for higher standards of living all around the world, which is more taxing on the environment and thus increases the risk for overpopulation.
</p>

<p>
Technology is also responsible for causing climate change, rising sea levels, and record temperatures around the world. As of the 2020s, advancing technology has only ever made climate change worse, and there are no clear signs that a technological solution to reverse the climate change that has occurred over the past three centuries is going to arise before it may become too late. Climate change and overpopulation both exacerbate each other.
</p>

<p>
Another problem with assuming that technology will solve overpopulation is that industrial technologically advanced societies require large populations in order to sustain themselves, lest there will be no specialization and no division of labor.
</p>

<p>
Relying on technology to always raise the society&rsquo;s carrying capacity is <i>not</i> a viable solution because populations naturally reproduce to infinity, and the only thing holding them back is the carrying capacity and the natural selection that results from that. Right now, the primary selectionary pressure on the human genome is birth control, which selects people who consciously choose to have children. Once the human population adapts to resist the limiting effects that birth control has on the human population, an unstoppable population explosion will happen, unless breaching the carrying capacity causes war, disease, and famine.
</p>

<p>
Cornucopians also argue that adding more people to the planet means that there will be more workers whose labor can increase the carrying capacity of the Earth, but even if that were true, one of the problems with that argument is that greater wealth enables longer lifespans. This means that there will be more retirees who aren&rsquo;t working at all who are living longer and not any additional labor to increase the carrying capacity of the Earth.

<h3 id="birth-control-and-other-factors"><span class="section-number-3">6.4.</span> Birth Control is the primary cause of declining birth rates, among other factors.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-birth-control-and-other-factors">
<p>
First off, let&rsquo;s re-emphasize the increased wealth seen in modern times is <b><i>not</i></b> the cause of the world&rsquo;s declining birth rates at all. The reader can re-read <a href="#rising-wealth-and-fertility">this section if they want to understand why.</a> The reason why the increased wealth of modernity currently correlates with decreased fertility rates, <a href="#wealth-and-fertility-rates-correlation">is explained in this section</a>.
</p>

<p>
The declining birth rates that have occurred worldwide since the 1960s are the result of the rising availability of birth control and its encouraged use. If all the birth control and contraception were to be eliminated, then the birth rates around the world would not have declined as they have in the past several decades. As of today (the 2020s), birth control is the primary selectionary pressure on the human genome, which selects people who consciously choose to have children. Once the human population adapts to resist the limiting effects that birth control has on the human population, an unstoppable population explosion will happen, unless breaching the carrying capacity causes war, disease, and famine.
</p>

<p>
It is true that birth control by itself isn&rsquo;t the only factor involved in lowering birth rates. Improved access to birth control and increased family planning methods have made it possible for women to delay having children in order to pursue careers, higher education, and other forms of personal fulfillment, rather than starting a family. These societal changes and ideologies like <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/01/what-is-feminism.html?view=classic">Feminism</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRRmqpsbVkY">Humanism</a> have also precipitated in a cultural feedback loop where it has become increasingly more socially acceptable for people to have fewer children or no children at all if they so choose. However, we still have to recognize that none of these cultural and societal changes ever would&rsquo;ve happen in the first place if it weren&rsquo;t for birth control. If children are born, people will have to care for them, instead of spending time on furthering their careers, education, and hobbies. Birth control made it possible to &ldquo;liberate&rdquo; people from the responsibility of having to care for children, so it is the ultimate factor in explaining why fertility rates have declined since the 1960s.
</p>

<p>
Some people have argued that reducing wealth inequality will reduce fertility rates since greater wealth equality correlates with lower fertility rates, but this is wrong for the same reason why it&rsquo;s wrong to conclude that raising living standards would lower fertility rates. <a href="#wealth-and-fertility-rates-correlation">The next section gives a better explanation</a> for the correlation between lower wealth inequality and lower fertility rates.

<div id="outline-container-wealth-and-fertility-rates-correlation" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="wealth-and-fertility-rates-correlation"><span class="section-number-3">6.5.</span> Why is there currently a negative correlation between wealth and fertility rates?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-wealth-and-fertility-rates-correlation">
<p>
It is frequently argued by proponents of DTT that the negative correlation between wealth and fertility rates proves that increasing wealth will decrease the fertility rates, but this reasoning is invalid because <b>correlation does not imply causation</b>. <a href="#rising-wealth-and-fertility">We have already explained in this section that basic reasoning, exhaustive historical evidence, and polling statistics concludes that increasing wealth would increase fertilty rates</a>, so it is unreasonable to conclude that increasing wealth would decrease fertility rates. A more plausible explanation for the correlation is that low fertility increases wealth. Having fewer children per family means that people can invest more energy into creating capital, instead of raising children. This is consistent with historical examples where lower fertility rates likely led to an increase in the production of wealth. To quote from <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/01/demography-and-destiny.html?view=classic">Demography and Destiny</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Low fertility might have played a role in the Industrial Revolution in Europe. Western Europeans had lower fertility than most other people around the world, due to the Western European marriage pattern. In Western Europe, women would often delay marriage and children until their mid twenties. The result was lower fertility, and more energy to invest in the creation of capital. Capital increases the efficiency of labor, which allows for more investment in capital, but only if the population does not expand to consume the additional production. The Industrial Revolution was one of the few times in human history when economic growth outpaced population growth, leading to prosperity.
</p>

<p>
(You can think of the IR as having two phases. The first phase was characterized by increased production, the second phase is characterized by decreased reproduction.)
</p>

<p>
The recent Chinese economic boom might also be partly due to lower fertility. There was a large decline in the Chinese fertility rate after the communist revolution. Roughly a generation later, the Chinese had a huge economic boom due to industrialization. This boom is usually explained solely in terms of a shift to a more open market economy. I believe that the shift to an open market is only part of the explanation for China&rsquo;s rapid industrialization and economic growth. I think it was also partly due to low fertility, which shifted energy and labor from the creation of human beings to the creation of capital. -Blithering Genius
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, we have to re-emphasize that the greater economic output that periods of lower fertility could cause are only <i>temporary</i>. As we can observe in developed countries with low fertility rates, economic growth is slowing down since the population is aging and fewer children are being born, which leads to lower economic growth.
</p>

<p>
Another explanation for the negative correlation between wealth and fertility rates is that wealthier countries tend to have greater access to birth control, which leads to lifestyle changes that lead to lower fertility rates. <a href="#birth-control-and-other-factors">In this section, we have explained why greater access to birth control is the cause of lower fertility rates</a>, not the increase of wealth.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, this negative correlation and its causes are not well-understood. This correlation and the fallacious attempts to explain it are the basis of the fallacious attempts to argue that increased wealth leads to decreased fertility rates, <a href="#rising-wealth-and-fertility">even though history has consistently shown the opposite</a>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-evolve-to-resist-birth-control">
<p>
The better question is: Why wouldn&rsquo;t this happen? Cultures that view contraception and abortion as being taboo have higher fertility rates, and evolution <i>always</i> selects for organisms that have higher fertility rates, as well as memetic traditions that promote higher fertility rates. <a href="#DTT-misconceptions">In this section, we have emphasized the importance of considering both genes <i>and</i> memes in conjunction with each other.</a>

<p>
Birth control causes lower fertility rates, and even if a majority of the population viewed lower fertility as being desirable for the sake of avoiding overpopulation, there is no way to guarantee that <i>every single person</i> is going to value low fertility and choose a low-fertility lifestyle for the sake of avoiding overpopulation. In the next section, we explain why <a href="#overpop-free-rider-problem">overpopulation is a free-rider problem</a>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-overpop-free-rider-problem" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="overpop-free-rider-problem"><span class="section-number-3">6.7.</span> Overpopulation is a free-rider problem, which will eventually transition into a tragedy of the commons.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-overpop-free-rider-problem">
<p>
The problem with assuming that overpopulation can be solved by most people choosing to have fewer children is that many people will choose <i>not</i> to have less children. The people who choose to have the highest fertility levels while everybody else has a below-replacement fertility thus create a free-rider problem. They will benefit from having a higher reproductive success, their children will benefit from having more resources available for them to exploit since everybody else chose to have fewer children, and everybody else will be negatively affected because they had lower reproductive success and fewer resources available for them since the high-fertility people left behind fewer resources for everybody else. For more info, see: <a href="#life-is-zero-sum">every existing organism can only exist at the cost of another</a>.
</p>

<p>
The human population will not be limited by voluntary low fertility, because evolution will eliminate the memes and genes associated with voluntarily low fertility. In an environment of abundance, in which most offspring live to adulthood, high fertility is selected for. Even if most people choose low fertility today, by doing so they select against the traits that make people choose low fertility. The future is determined by who shows up. Human nature (like the nature of every other kind of life) is determined by who reproduces. Those who reproduce pass their traits on. Modern abundance has not taken the struggle out of life. It has just changed the nature of the struggle, from a struggle over resources to a breeding contest. Right now, whoever has the most kids wins.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s true that most people in developed societies choose to have few or no children. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that most people in the future will have low fertility. Why? Because people in the future have to be born, and more of them will be born to people with high fertility than low fertility. Even if almost everyone chooses low fertility, those with higher fertility will simply outbreed them in a few generations. For example, the Amish alone, could replace the entire world population in less than 300 years, at their current rate of growth.
</p>

<p>
Whether we like it or not, the only to prevent overpopulation is to mandatorily impose on <i>everybody</i>. If most people are trying to maintain a low fertility population, but a few do not, then population growth is a Free Rider Problem. On the other hand, if everybody is trying to reproduce as much as possible, and there is no population control to prevent the population from exceeding the carrying capacity, than population growth is a Tragedy of the Commons. Over time, population growth will transition from being a Free Rider Problem (as it currently is) to becoming a Tragedy of the Commons. Either way, population growth is a game theoretic problem. And since the purpose of Government is to solve game-theoretic problems, government is the perfect (and only) solution to solving overpopulation.

<div id="outline-container-DTT-misconceptions" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="DTT-misconceptions"><span class="section-number-3">6.8.</span> Doesn&rsquo;t your reasoning for refuting DTT conflate memes with genes?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-DTT-misconceptions">
<p>
No, and for several reasons:
</p>

<p>
First off, statistics consistently show that less educated, less intelligent, and more religious people tend to have more children than people who are more educated, more intelligent, and atheist. <a href="https://jaymans.wordpress.com/jaymans-race-inheritance-and-iq-f-a-q-f-r-b/#nogeneforx">Intelligence is well-documented to be a polygenic trait with an estimated 0.8 heritability</a>. Even though the world has become more educated and more atheist in the last few decades, there is no reason to believe that the world will continue to become increasingly more educated and more atheist when those people have fewer children than people who are less educated and more religious. It follows that the world will become more religious and more uneducated since those memes increase fertility and will result in a feedback loop. Studies have repeatedly shown that the vast majority of people stay within the religion they were born into.
</p>

<p>
Second, there is the concept of <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/11/adaptive-coherence.html?view=classic">Adaptive Coherence</a>. Basically, genes and memes work together, so if memes like religion are currently causing religious people to have more children, then the genes that are associated with higher religious beliefs are going to get reproduced with greater frequency than genes that make people more likely to be Atheist and such. Even when our reasoning is evaluating the effects of memes instead of genes, we still have to consider genes due to Adaptive Coherence.
</p>

<p>
Third, Cornucopians are ignoring that memes can be reasonably categorized into <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/12/god-is-telomeme.html?view=classic">&ldquo;Traditions&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fashions/Cults&rdquo;</a>. Religions would be categorized as &ldquo;Traditions&rdquo; because they propagate from parent to child and tend to increase reproductive success, whereas memes like Feminism and Antinatalism would be categorized as fashions because they tend to propagate between peers, not from parents to children. Fashions like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism">Feminism</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinatalism">Antinatalism</a> may be temporarily increasing in popularity now, but neither of them promotes reproductive success, so they are both destined to decline in their numbers of believers, given enough generations passing by. Fashions tend to be temporary phenomena, whereas Traditions are stable phenomena that tend to outlast Fashions in the long-term since they encourage reproductive success, whereas Fashions do not.
</p>

<p>
Fourth, populations cannot be thought of as conglomerates because different segments of the population have the potential to grow exponentially. Consider the following quoted paragraphs from the essay <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/01/demography-and-destiny.html?view=classic">Demography and Destiny</a>:
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
For example, Islam is expanding rapidly due to population growth. That is because Muslims, and especially fundamentalist Muslims, have higher average fertility. They keep women in the home making babies. The Muslim world has grown more fundamentalist in the last 50 years, mainly because fundamentalists had more children than secularists and moderates in Muslim societies. Islam is now spreading to the West, due to population pressure. Muslims are replacing the declining native population of Europe, which has very low fertility.
</p>

<p>
There are other examples of religions that promote fertility. Take the Amish for example. Their current rate of population growth corresponds to doubling every 20 years. That is almost entirely due to reproduction &#x2013; there is very little conversion into the Amish community. At their current rate of growth, the Amish population would exceed the current world population in less than 300 years, starting from its current size of 250,000. If everyone else went through the demographic transition except the Amish, then after 300 years the global population would be almost entirely Amish.
</p>

<p>
In spite of being anti-modern, the Muslims and the Amish are adapted to modernity. They reproduce their genes and their memes. As time goes on, other adaptations will emerge. One thing is certain: humanity will not settle into a stable pattern of low fertility unless we impose it on ourselves. -Blithering Genius

<div id="outline-container-declining-birth-rates" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="declining-birth-rates"><span class="section-number-3">6.9.</span> Why should we worry about overpopulation when birth rates are decreasing around the world?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-declining-birth-rates">
<p>
It is true that the birth rate is declining. But the population is still increasing, just more slowly. Not only that, but people are living longer than ever, which further contributes to overpopulation. It&rsquo;s also possible that newer technologies could prolong human lifespans even further in the future, which would further increasing the rate of population growth.
</p>

<p>
As the developing world transitions towards more developed, first-world lifestyles, that will put further strain on the world&rsquo;s resources, even if the world population were to stay the same and not grow at all.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, as it is explained in this section, <a href="#rising-wealth-and-fertility">increasing the world&rsquo;s living standards would increase the world&rsquo;s fertility levels</a>, if it wasn&rsquo;t for the wide availability of contraception that tends to correlate with wealthier societies. Once people who don&rsquo;t use contraception are selected for, the world&rsquo;s fertility levels will continue to rise ever more until they hit the carrying capacity, if that doesn&rsquo;t already happen beforehand.
</p>

<p>
And to be clear, promoting contraception in places that previously didn&rsquo;t have access to it is <i>not</i> population control. You could do one of two things to encourage people to vote: fine people for not voting, or advertising that people should vote. The latter option isn&rsquo;t really &ldquo;control&rdquo; if you&rsquo;re essentially just asking nicely.

<p>
Based on a correct understanding of how evolution works, a recognition that Earth has finite resources (with the above examples and then some), and an understanding that infinite population growth is mathematically unsustainable when resources are finite, we support legally-enforced population control via reproduction licenses. We don&rsquo;t support population control because we want eugenics, we support it because we want humanity to avoid famines and the wars that would result from said famines.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-managing-resources-better">
<p>
That would only be temporary solution at best. Although managing our resources better would indeed raise the carrying capacity of the Earth, <a href="#rising-wealth-and-fertility">it is explained in this section that rising living standards have consistently lead to population booms through human history</a>. It is also a fact of biology that <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html">populations always reproduce up to their carrying capacities</a>.
</p>

<p>
For those reasons, raising the carrying capacity of the Earth is <i>not</i> a permanent solution for preventing overpopulation. The only way to permanently prevent overpopulation from ever occurring is to have a top-down authority that enforces mandatory population control, since <a href="#overpop-free-rider-problem">since overpopulation is a free-rider problem that can only be resolved by government</a>.

</p>

<p>
Perhaps the world population will peak at 12 billion around 2060 or so, but the modeling and reasoning used to make this conclusion relies on false assumptions about biology, evolution, and fertility, and the DTT models for 2060 are all assuming that overpopulation won&rsquo;t occur before then. And even if the Earth does miraculously manage to sustain 12 billion people by 2060, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that overpopulation would not be something to worry about, since <a href="#what-is-overpop">there are still other factors that can affect overpopulation</a> even if the population enters a period of decline, especially <a href="#next-overpop-crisis">if all the infrastructure, systems, and/or technology that sustain such a high population were to fail</a> for one reason or another.

We don&rsquo;t know, and that is very difficult to predict since there are too many factors and unknown events that will affect the future.

And if a <a href="#next-overpop-crisis">major war breaks out between the world&rsquo;s largest super powers</a> within the next decade or so, then the early-to-mid 21st century is an even earlier prediction.

<p>
If this proved to be an actual problem, then the solution is to fix the economy, instead of trying to perilously maintain a dangerously high population or to enable unsustainable population growth.

</p>

<p>
Not only that, but this is actually an argument <i>for</i> population control (in the long run). Since population control would ensure that the society&rsquo;s population stays at a very stable and constant size for decades, centuries, or even millennia to come, then this would ensure that we wouldn&rsquo;t have any future situations where there aren&rsquo;t enough humans in newer generations to support older generations.

For every new child who is born, it&rsquo;s also far more likely that would only be one of the billions of people who are further contributing to the next overpopulation crisis, rather than raising the Earth&rsquo;s carrying capacity or doing other things that would otherwise contribute to Humanity more than whatever toll they have from consuming more resources. Each new low-to-average intelligence people is going to have their own interests (which won&rsquo;t necessarily be productive or constructive) and competition for scarce resources. It would definitely be more rational to find ways to make existing people more intelligent or useful to others while enforcing <a href="../FAQs/EPC-FAQs.html#reproduction-license-reqs">reasonable population control measures</a>, rather than continuing to allow unregulated reproduction.

<h2 id="human-rights"><span class="section-number-2">11.</span> Would population control violate human rights?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-human-rights">
<p>
There are plenty of good reasons why EPC would protect human rights, not violate them. To clarify, we&rsquo;re not proposing that it should be impossible for some people to have children based on predetermined factors, we&rsquo;re just proposing that there should be reasonable limits on how many children people should be allowed to have. Nowadays, most children live to adulthood, so it&rsquo;s not as necessary as it was historically to have as large families anyway. As explained here, <a href="#why-DTT-is-wrong">voluntarily low fertility is not a feasible solution</a> for preventing overpopulation.
</p>

<p>
A child that cannot be supported by its parents is either a burden on the rest of society (which harms other members of society), or it will be harmed by neglect. Uncontrolled reproduction inflicts harm on others, so there is a clear ethical basis for socially controlling reproduction.
</p>

<p>
Also, licenses are already required to adopt children in order to ensure that the children will be placed in good care, so it is logically inconsistent to <i>not</i> also require licenses for people to have biological children. Almost no one would argue that the rights of prospective adoptive parents are being violated if they are prohibited from adopting children due to not meeting the licensing requirements, assuming that the requirements are reasonable and fair to everybody (including gay couples).
</p>

<p>
EPC would select against any genetic causes of criminal behavior, thus offering further protection of human rights by significantly reducing crimes against innocent people.
</p>

<p>
Rights are whatever people decide they are, and circumstances can cause peoples&rsquo; opinions to change on what rights should be, so the only legitimate rights are legal rights, whereas moral rights are nonsense since <a href="../FAQs/post-overton-FAQs.html">morality depends on perspective</a>. Any proposed set of rights should be designed so that rights don&rsquo;t contradict each other, and ideally all the rights proposed would protect and reinforce each other. People may argue that population control violates people&rsquo;s autonomy, but since the benefit is that it will confer more protection to all other rights via all the ways listed in this section, the benefits outweigh the costs and it&rsquo;s thus a reasonable change to make.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, it is extremely important to emphasize here that what&rsquo;s at stake here is whether modern technological society thrives or permanently collapses forever. When a population reaches its carrying capacity, <a href="#life-is-zero-sum">Life becomes a zero-sum game where every existing organism can only exist at the cost of another</a>, thus resulting in famine, war, and disease. For anybody who values humanity having a prosperous, thriving future for humanity, what could be more important than maintaining that for humanity&rsquo;s future? If Industrial Society does collapse, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AoDTlbRRkw">there&rsquo;s a strong possibility that it will never recover</a> and that the world will be eternally stuck living an 18th-century lifestyle.

But if our opponents are going to insist on playing games deciding who truly has the moral high-ground, then it is <i>unquestionably</i> more &ldquo;moral&rdquo; to enforce population control if it prevents <i>literally billions</i> of people from dying due to overpopulation.
</p>

<p>
It also ought to be considered moral to ensure that parents who have children are guaranteed to take of their children and be self-sufficient.

No reasonable person who prefers that the conditions of modernity continue for humanity&rsquo;s foreseeable future would argue in good faith that the collapse of modern civilization is better than enforcing population control. If modern civilization collapses, humanity will likely return to a world that is most like pre-industrial 17th century Europe where most infants die young due to disease, since modern vaccinations will no longer be available since the technology for enabling them would cease to exist.

<h2 id="abortion"><span class="section-number-2">13.</span> But abortion is immoral.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-abortion">
<p>
<a href="https://data.unicef.org/topic/hivaids/orphanhood/">According to UNICEF</a>, there are 147 million orphans (0-17 years old) worldwide, as of 2021. If anti-abortionist pro-lifers want to be taken seriously, then they need to put their time and money where their mouth is and offer to adopt children that other people don&rsquo;t want and/or cannot afford to take care of.
</p>

<p>
If pro-lifers are not willing to adopt an orphan(s), then they can kindly concede that their moral dogma is not feasible, sustainable, nor reasonable. Moreover, <a href="../FAQs/post-overton-FAQs.html">morality is an illusion</a>.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, as it has already been explained in this FAQs, if there is no population control exerted on a human population, there is destined to be (eventual) war, disease, and famine. If we decide as a species that population control is vastly more preferable than the alternative, then abortion is necessary, and that concludes that the values and arguments made by pro-lifers to be null and void.
</p>

<p>
Being pro-life doesn&rsquo;t make sense from a biological context anyway. Populations naturally reproduce towards infinity, so if one baby is aborted, they&rsquo;ll simply be replaced by another life form until the population reaches the carrying capacity.

<h2 id="support-of-eugenicists"><span class="section-number-2">14.</span> But eugenicists support overpopulation theory.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-support-of-eugenicists">
<p>
Yes, they did and still do. Regardless of your opinion on eugenics, it is a guilt by association fallacy to oppose something solely because someone else supports it. Doing so would be as fallacious as saying: &ldquo;Nazis drank water, so drinking water is bad!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Moreover, opposing eugenics is naive and misguided too. There are already <a href="../FAQs/EPC-FAQs.html#eugenics-in-modern-society">several situations where socially-acceptable eugenics are commonly practiced</a> in society, and even encouraged. <a href="../FAQs/EPC-FAQs.html#why-implement-eugenics">The Eugenics FAQS page</a> provides several good reasons why humanity should implement eugenics, and why it will eventually be doomed if it doesn&rsquo;t.
</p>

<p>
One reason why eugenicists tend to support population control and vice versa is that Population Control can have eugenic effects on populations, <a href="#PC-and-eugenics">when it&rsquo;s done in the manner explained in this section</a>.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-PC-and-eugenics" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="PC-and-eugenics"><span class="section-number-2">15.</span> How is population control related to eugenics?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-PC-and-eugenics">
<p>
First, we have to distinguish between different proposals for population control. If population control is administered such that every couple can only have a fixed number of children (e.g. the One Child Policy in China), then that would have some eugenic effects since it would limit the proliferation of dysgenic genes, but it would also have dysgenic effects since it would limit the proliferation of eugenic genes.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if population control is administered via a system that selects for eugenic effects while limiting the selection of dysgenic genes, then population control is destined to have eugenic effects. The is the <a href="../FAQs/EPC-FAQs.html#why-laissez-faire-is-best">laissez-faire approach to eugenics</a>. When a population reaches the carrying capacity of its environment, competition and eugenic selection occur in order to select the organisms that are the most reproductively successful in the scarce resources environment. In this case, the carrying capacity is set by a <a href="#LMPL">legal limit</a>, and the selectionary pressures are applied via <a href="#overpop-solution">reproduction licenses</a>.
</p>

<p>
Since industrialization and technological advancement have removed the selectionary pressures on humanity and limitations that have traditionally limited the carrying capacity of the human population, not only has this caused dysgenics from the removal of said selectionary pressures, but it is also causing overpopulation. That said, if we achieved <a href="#overpop-solution">legally-enforced population control for humanity</a>, then we would be placing artificial selectionary pressures that will increase the eugenic quality of the human population, that would otherwise never occur.
</p>

<p>
If someone is going to be in favor of population control, they ought to be in favor of <a href="#overpop-solution">laissez-faire eugenics</a> as well (top-down eugenics would fail the same reason why command economies fail). Many people today are against eugenics because it would require restricting some people from having children, but population control does the same thing and population control will be necessary in order to prevent catastrophic disasters from happening in the future, so this is not a good argument against eugenics.

<div id="outline-container-georgism-and-EPC" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="georgism-and-EPC"><span class="section-number-2">16.</span> How is Georgism related to population control?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-georgism-and-EPC">
<p>
Georgism and Population Control both aim to conserve resources and deal with natural resources that exist in fixed supply. As a result, the two both compliment each other extremely well, and not by coincidence if we expand the notion of &ldquo;natural resources&rdquo; to also include the finite supply of organisms that can theoretically exist within a finite environment. Since life is a zero-sum competition game for energy when a population reaches its carrying capacity, anybody who has children in such an environment would be doing so at the cost of preventing other people to have children as well. This is very similar to how anybody who occupies a parcel of land prevents other people from using that parcel.

<div id="outline-container-effects-on-society" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="effects-on-society"><span class="section-number-2">17.</span> How would population control affect family structures and people&rsquo;s lives?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-effects-on-society">
<p>
Since the <a href="#overpop-solution">proposed requirements</a> would require couples to sign a child-bearing agreement together with one of them being employed in a full-time job, this means that marriage rates would likely increase and happen at earlier ages, which would reverse the current trend where it has been becoming increasing more common for children to be born to parents out of wedlock in recent decades. This would instantly eliminate single-parent households, thus resulting in a society with much more desirable family structure and greater social stability.
</p>

<p>
The law require two people to sign a contractual child-bearing agreement together. This contract will usually be between two people who are married, and while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTBPPc-IexI">we favor monogamous marriages</a>, we don&rsquo;t necessarily want to require this since the most important thing is that legal responsibilities are imposed on the parents, and also because we want to enable compatibility with both life-long monogamy or complete sexual freedom. This would leave it entirely up to individuals to decide how to arrange their love lives, and it would only regulate reproduction.
</p>

<p>
Population control would cause us to move from the traditionally high fertility levels that human societies have historically had to relatively low fertility levels, so this would necessitate redefining the role of women in society, compared to what it has been traditionally (raising children and housekeeping). A society with population control would also be a society where women raise fewer children on average, so this would mean that women would be spending more time doing other things, like working paid jobs in the economy.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, since population control would make it harder to have children, this would make having children higher status among both men and women. In modern society, having children has become lower status since it&rsquo;s become more socially acceptable for people to not have children. Enforcing population control would reverse that trend since people, especially men, are socially driven to pursue higher status. When people see other people with lots of children, people will learn to associate having lots of children with higher social status, as things should be. This is a good thing because this <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/03/alienation-and-art.html">reduces the alienation from our natural biological instincts</a> that has been caused by modern technology and it also keeps us more in sync with our <a href="../epistemology/axiology.html#reproduction-ultimate-value">biological purpose</a>.
</p>

<p>
This would also balance out the sexual market. Since it would be illegal to have children without another parent who is legally contracted to help raise the child, there would be no more single mothers, who are highly undesirable for men to date for a number of reasons. This would increase the number of women for men to date.
</p>

<p>
Another factor that would balance out the sexual market is how women wouldn&rsquo;t be liberated from men anymore. The modern welfare state and culture of modernity have liberated women from men. [elaborate on this]

In the interest of preserving modern civilization and preventing war, disease, and famine, there must be a <a href="#LMPL">maximum population limit</a> enforced for the country&rsquo;s total number of citizens by requiring anybody who wants to have children to acquire a Reproduction License for each child that they want to have. A reproduction license will be granted to every couple of parents who manages to meet all of the following requirements:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The parent must be law-abiding and have no criminal record.</li>
<li>The parent must have a high school education [at least] and must have reached the <a href="../civilization/age-of-adulthood.html">legal age of adulthood</a>.</li>

<p>
The social control of reproduction is not a new idea. It is a very old and almost universal practice. In the past, reproduction was controlled by the institution of marriage. Almost every society had some form of marriage that regulated human sexual behavior. Sex outside marriage was not allowed. We abandoned the traditional control of reproduction without understanding its function or the consequences of abandoning it. We are now seeing the consequences (and paying the costs) of abandoning marriage. It is time to replace marriage with a modern form of reproduction control.

<div id="outline-container-chinas-one-child-policy" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="chinas-one-child-policy"><span class="section-number-3">18.1.</span> Would this proposal be done similarly to the One Child Policy in China?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-chinas-one-child-policy">
<p>
No, it would be done <i>very</i> differently. For the record, we <i>very</i> strongly condemn how the One Child Policy was implemented in China. It was inequitable, violently enforced, unnecessarily authoritarian to a great degree, poorly planned, <a href="#PC-and-eugenics">did not promote eugenics</a>, and it caused many negative social and economic outcomes including but not limited to: 20 million men being destined to never find a partner due to widespread female infanticide, a strong economic decline in China that will take place in the 2020s and 2030s, and many ruined lives by unnecessary forced medical procedures.
</p>

<p>
First off, we are not proposing that every couple should be limited to only one child. Instead, we are proposing <a href="../economics/georgism-EPC-connection.html">an equitable solution where people can have as many children as they have reproduction licenses for</a>, as according to the supply, demand, and price of reproduction licenses. It also has naturally eugenic effects, which just happens to be a positive, coincidental side effect of the economic reasoning that we used. Since the policy that we are proposing is more adjustable, it won&rsquo;t result in population busts or economic depressions like what China is/will experience during the 2020s and 2030s.
</p>

<p>
Second, we are opposed to the violent and authoritarian policies that China used to punish people who violated the One Child Policy. Since we are not in favor of imposing a fixed quota on how many children a couple can have, we would never sterilize people after they&rsquo;ve had a certain number of licensed children. The only people who might get sterilized are murderers, rapists, felons, and people who have unlicensed children, but even if unlicensed children are born, we will try the least authoritarian approach first. Since we are not in favor of restricting people to having only one child, this also means that our system would require imposing far fewer legal penalties against people who violate the population control laws.
</p>

<p>
Third, we have outlined <a href="#banning-female-infanticide">several measures that a government can implement that are guaranteed to prevent female infanticide</a>. Over time, cultural factors would further prevent female infanticide.

<h3 id="higher-pops-solutions"><span class="section-number-3">18.2.</span> Solutions For Enabling Higher Populations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-higher-pops-solutions">
<p>
If humanity is going to sustain higher populations, then it will be necessary for everybody to adopt lifestyles and technologies that make higher populations possible. We have to keep in mind that although this list of ideas would make larger populations possible, in the long-term (~2100 and onward), they are completely insufficient for preventing overpopulation since they do nothing to reduce fertility rates.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="../economics/georgism-elevator-pitch.html">Land Distribution</a>: This goes without saying, but higher populations and greater population densities will necessitate that land be used as efficiently as possible.</li>
<li>Insect Agriculture and Aqua-Agriculture: Meat is very expensive and taxing on the environment to produce. By contrast, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvQTmTPZix4">insects have many advantages over livestock</a>: they are cheaper, take up less space, are more nutritious, and there are thousands to choose from. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBVXenVpfVM">The Blue Revolution is also very promising for increasing humanity&rsquo;s future food production</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism">GMOs</a>: GMOs make it possible to produce food in higher quantities with higher nutrition.</li>
<li>Vaccinations: The more people in constant contact with one another, the faster diseases spread and the more important herd immunity becomes. Vaccinations can eliminate this concern.</li>
<li>Having fewer pets would enable having more humans on the planet, since resources could be directed towards more humans instead of pets. These days, a lot of child-free people choose to have pets instead of having children, but those people will eventually be replaced by those who have children instead.</li>
<li>Nuclear energy is probably the most reliable and efficient option for solving the world&rsquo;s energy needs. It also produces no carbon emissions, doesn&rsquo;t require damming up rivers, nor does it kill birds and animals. It does require storing nuclear waste in places where it can remain permanently, and it can have occasional nuclear accidents, but those are both becoming less of problems over time as we figure out better solutions and safer technologies.</li>
<li>Smart Electrical Meters: More people means more work and money spent for meter readers, so smart meters make more sense. That saves money and redirects meter readers to more productive fields. Privacy may be a concern, but when it comes to population planning, you either get more people or more privacy, not both.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some people may be opposed to these ideas, but that is the cost of having to live in a high-population world that is densely populated. It&rsquo;s particularly ironic that many people (especially Libertarians) oppose these ideas, despite insisting that humanity will never have to worry about overpopulation and that human ingenuity (i.e. the ideas listed above) will prevent overpopulation.

<h3 id="most-likely-enforcement"><span class="section-number-3">19.1.</span> The Most Likely Way How Population Control Would Be Enforced</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-most-likely-enforcement">
<p>
The government will start with the least authoritarian and least invasive methods for enforcing population control, and if those methods for enforcing the law, then they will be the status quo. It will be a felony for anyone to have children without a reproduction license, so there will already be strong incentives for people to comply with the law. If unlicensed children are born, but the parents would still be responsible for paying for the child&rsquo;s existence, and paying back society for the incurred costs. This could be done by fining the parents at a fee that is 50% higher than the cost of a reproduction license. If they are unable to pay that, then they will be placed in a debtor&rsquo;s prison until they pay off their debt to society. They will also be monitored with regular birth control testing to ensure that they don&rsquo;t break the law again.
</p>

<p>
If someone does happen to intentionally or accidentally conceive a child, and they refuse to buy a reproduction license to pay for the child&rsquo;s existence, then the embryo/fetus will have to be aborted as soon as possible. This eliminates the need to euthanize children who have already been born. Additionally, any pregnancy that results from a rape must be aborted immediately. The rapist would automatically be disqualified from being able to obtain a reproduction license since rape is a felony, as is conceiving children without meeting <a href="../FAQs/EPC-FAQs.html#reproduction-license-reqs">the reproduction license requirements</a>. Evolutionary Reasoning gives a really good reason to make it legal to abort fetuses that resulted from rape, since not aborting said fetuses would select for genes that make people more likely to rape.

<p>
Once again, <a href="#if-no-pop-regulation">this is we will have to deal with if we don&rsquo;t regulate our population</a>. If a meteor was heading towards Earth, would you argue that we shouldn&rsquo;t destroy or redirect it, merely because it would be &ldquo;too difficult&rdquo; to try that? If it is absolutely necessary to enforce population control in the interest of preventing unprecedented apocalyptic scenarios, then any argument that population control will be too difficult or morally objectionable to enforce does not constitute a valid refutation against population control. We recognize that the proposed methods for implementing population control on this FAQs page may be very undesirable for most people, but we have proposed them nonetheless because we strongly believe that they are the most minimal set of restrictions to impose for preventing global overpopulation and its unprecedented consequences.
</p>

<p>
Instead of arguing against the proposed implementation of population control, it would be vastly more productive for people who are opposed to population control to decisively prove with sound arguments that it is unnecessary to be cautious about overpopulation. If people can successfully prove that population control will not be necessary to prevent <a href="#if-no-pop-regulation">its disastrous consequences in the future</a>, then we will concede that there is no reason to enforce population control, and no reason to debate <i>how</i> population control should be implemented. Until the opposition provides a sound and convincing argument why population control is unnecessary, that is the primary topic to be debated.
</p>

<p>
But to answer the question: No. Population control would be easier than enforcing many current laws, including traffic regulations and the law against murder. The law against murder is difficult to enforce because it is often difficult to identify murderers. Some murders go unsolved. No one uses this as an argument that murder should be legal. It is much easier to identify people who have unlicensed children than it currently is to identify murderers. It&rsquo;s pretty hard to conceal a child. <i>They will be found eventually.</i> If bounty programs are necessary in order to find and report unlicensed children, then so be it.

That might be true, but it doesn&rsquo;t refute how overpopulation is a serious issue that we will have to deal with later in the 21st century, whether we like it or not. We can deal with this <a href="#overpop-solution">preemptively via population-control</a>, or we can choose to <a href="#if-no-pop-regulation">do nothing and suffer the consequences of that</a>.

Life is intrinsically violent. Force is built into the nature of life, and <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/07/circles-of-control-and-freedom.html?view=classic">the only way to escape violence within a society is to impose the threat of violence if the laws are not followed</a>.
In this case, we can either choose between <a href="#if-no-pop-regulation">violence in the form of famine and war caused by unregulated overpopulation</a>, or we choose the much more peaceful and sustainable choice of force if one disobeys the population control laws. We might as well apply force on society in a controlled way that eventually leads to less violence over time, as genes that cause higher crime rates are removed from the gene pool via this proposed selectionary process.

<h2 id="banning-female-infanticide"><span class="section-number-2">20.</span> Would regulating reproduction cause female infanticide in countries like China and India?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-banning-female-infanticide">
<p>
No, because we can assume that any government that has the power to enforce EPC would also have the authority to enforce a law that bans female infanticide. In the interest of ensuring an equalized sex ratio for the country&rsquo;s population, female infanticide will be outlawed, unless it can be proven that the fetus/infant had severe birth defects, a severe genetic disease, etc. If it parents were tempted to kill their female children because they wanted a son instead, then the government could simply create a law that forbids those parents from ever possessing another reproduction license and the couple would not get a refund, which would guarantee an equalized demographic sex ratio. All parents must accept the sex of the child that they give birth to, or else they will be forbidden from having any children at all.
</p>

<p>
Since the parents would have to have a reproduction license <i>before</i> they conceive a child in the womb, the government could ensure that that the child will be born by contractually requiring the prospective parents to carry the child until birth, regardless of the sex of the fetus. This would prevent couples from trying to abort female fetuses while they are still in the womb. If the child was aborted for any reason, then the reason has to be documented. If the reason for the abortion was merely because the fetus was female, then the couple would permanently lose their reproductive rights and would not get a refund.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, since shifting to a relatively low fertility country (in comparison to historical trends) would necessitate that women would be spending more time doing other things besides just raising children, that should cause female children to be perceived as being more valuable in countries where female infanticide is a cultural problem, which would further help to reduce the problem altogether.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, if a couple of parents only had daughters born, but they still wanted a son, then they can still have a son as long as they buy another reproduction license and they happen to give birth to a son. Generally speaking however, creating artificial barriers to reproduction would make having children of higher social status because having children would become harder to achieve. This is a good thing because it would cause parents to value their children more, regardless of whatever sex they children may be born as.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-licenses-and-elderly">
<p>
No, because population control would be enforced via reproduction licenses. But if this is what the question is referring to, then this misunderstands what the reproduction licenses are for. They are not a license for a person to live, they are a license for two parents to have a child in one if they meet <a href="#overpop-solution">the requirements</a>. Since only a finite maximum number of children can be born within each year, this would mean that the total population of the country would have very little variation and would stay roughly constant for many years or decades, assuming that the government doesn&rsquo;t pass a law to change the maximum population birth rate.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-georgist-reasoning-and-elderly">
<p>
Some Georgists might object that if we limit the number of people who can be born each year on the basis that it is economic land (every couple of parents needs a license for each child that they have), then everybody also needs a license to live since the country has a legal maximum population size, and therefore only a finite number of people can live in the country at a time.
</p>

<p>
But this does not follow because under the EPC system that we are proposing, there would be <a href="#PBS">some amount of buffer room</a> between the Legal Maximum Population Limit (LMPL) and the carrying capacity of the environment to avoid overpopulation, so if the carrying capacity dropped during an emergency, there wouldn&rsquo;t be a need to decide who gets to live and who doesn&rsquo;t, nor would it be necessary to kill off the most elderly members of the society in the event of an overpopulation crisis (when the population is dangerously higher than the carrying capacity).

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-LMPL">
<p>
LMPL: Legal Maximum Population Limit
</p>

<p>
For starters, we should consider the definition and causes of overpopulation, which we shall restate here for convenience. Overpopulation is determined by at least four parameters:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Number of creatures (usually of a single species) in an area</li>
<li>An area and its resources</li>
<li>The average ecological footprint per creature (for humans, this is the average standard of living per capita)</li>
<li>A timeframe</li>
<li>(for humans) The technology and substitution options available to those creatures</li>
<li>(for humans) The distribution of wealth and opportunities (which is <a href="../economics/georgism-elevator-pitch.html">heavily influenced by the system of property norms</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>
If we want to estimate what the carrying capacity of the Earth is, some reasonable calculations to start with would be to multiply the number of people living in the society by the expected consumption of various resources that we would expect of each person for food, water, electricity, living space, etc. These calculations could be compared to what we expect the supplies for each of these resources to be, and the resource with the lowest supply would determine what number of people the LMPL should be allocated for the foreseeable future.
</p>

<p>
The hardest factor to consider for overpopulation would probably be the timeframe since it is very difficult to predict the future, but we predict that it will be easier to take the timeframe into consideration if the population control system is implemented, the population stabilizes, and humanity learns from its mistakes.
</p>

<p>
However, we will note that since timeframe and changing circumstances are the most unpredictable factor for affecting an environment&rsquo;s carrying capacity, that drastically reduces the certainty of any predictions that could be made.

<div id="outline-container-multiple-carrying-capacities" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="multiple-carrying-capacities"><span class="section-number-3">22.1.</span> Calculating multiple different carrying capacities for differing conditions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-multiple-carrying-capacities">
<p>
Although modern first-world civilizations have the highest carrying capacity of any other time in history, we know that that carrying capacity of that environment is currently declining due to our exhaustion of the Earth&rsquo;s scarce resources. We can also predict that if any node of the interconnected systems that enable us to live our current lifestyles were to fail (destruction of critical infrastructure, labor strikes, closure of trade routes, the depletion of fossil fuel reserves, warfare, etc), that would jeopardize our lifestyles and cause the carrying capacity to fall.
</p>

<p>
That being said, it makes sense to calculate multiple different theoretical carrying capacities for each region, given a set of different conditions. For example, we could predict carrying capacities for the following societal structures:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Hunter-gatherer society</li>
<li>Neolithic, agricultural society</li>
<li>Pre-Industrial 17-18th century society</li>
<li>Industrial 19-20th century society, with global free trade and globalization</li>
<li>Modern, first-world 21st century society</li>
<li>Modern 21st century society with Georgism and other economic solutions for raising the carrying capacity to the furthest extent possible</li>
</ul>
<p>
The purpose of calculating how these different conditions would change the carrying capacity of the environment would be to theorize what we should set the new LMPL to be if modern civilization were to collapse, so that we can prepare for a collapse (if it were predictable).
</p>

<p>
The LMPL would be determined by the carrying capacity whose conditions we think are the most probable for the future.

<p>
PBS: Population Buffer Space

<p>
When in doubt, more buffer space is better than less buffer space since it gives the government more options and flexibility if the future seems particularly uncertain.
</p>

<p>
Over time, data from previous decisions, events, and effects pertaining to the carrying capacity and population control would accumulate and provide the government of the current time period with more data for making better decisions on how to estimate the carrying capacity, and how to determine what the LMPL and PBS between the carrying capacity should be.

<a href="../civilization/ideal-government.html#objections-to-global-government">We&rsquo;ve listed all our reasons here why it is reasonable to create a global government to help solve the world&rsquo;s problems</a>. Most of the influence that a global government might have on population control at the national and local levels, would probably be applied indirectly (e.g. regulating each jurisdiction&rsquo;s carbon emissions and natural resource taxation). Aside from that, most of the laws concerning population control, such as reproduction licenses would probably be enforced on a local or national level, so it&rsquo;s not necessary to enforce them with a global government.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-black-plague-false-predictions">
<p>
I once had a history teacher who estimated that that the current population of Europe would be 10 times greater if the Black Plague never happened, but this uses fallacious reasoning. There&rsquo;s no way that could ever happen anyway since that would require increasing the carrying capacity of Europe by ten-fold as a result of the black plague never happening.
</p>

<p>
Yes, the Black Plague did reduce the European population by about a third, but since biological populations are selected to reproduce up to the carrying capacity, it&rsquo;s more likely that the black plague only temporarily widened the gap between the current population and its maximum carrying capacity. Since there were temporarily more resources per capita available to all the living humans due to the massive decline in population, this means that the surviving humans were likely able to have more children than previous generations. Thus, the European population would&rsquo;ve returned to the carrying capacity irregardless of whether the plague ever happened.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-likeliness-of-pop-control">
<p>
At the current rate, we think that it is very unlikely. We believe that the most likely outcome for the mid-to-late 21st century is that civilization collapses due to economic instability, overpopulation, dysgenics, political corruption, mass ignorance, and the exhaustion of the Earth&rsquo;s scarce natural resources. If this happens, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AoDTlbRRkw">civilization will probably never resurrects itself</a>.
</p>

<p>
We recognize that population control is a very contentious topic, and although most people will probably never accept that it may be necessary to sustain modern civilization due to their strongly held moral beliefs, all we can do is to appeal to people&rsquo;s rationality by making sound arguments like the ones that appear on this FAQs page. We can hope that that will be enough to get people to finally acknowledge the great peril that is awaiting us in the coming decades, and we can hope that this might motivate people to do something to prevent it. <a href="../epistemology/difficult-to-change-peoples-minds.html">Most people will probably never listen to us</a>, but we have to try anyways, lest we face the certain permanent destruction of our civilization.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-next-overpop-crisis">
<p>
The next major overpopulation crisis will probably happen when a catastrophic event causes the carrying capacity to suddenly and unexpectedly shrink, rather than the population surpassing a stagnant carrying capacity. If this happens, it&rsquo;ll probably less likely to be caused by a blight or disease in the food supply since modern agricultural techniques probably use more genetically diverse crops, but we still cannot underestimate the potential for such massive catastrophes. Instead, the next major event that could cause a worldwide overpopulation crisis is more likely to be a massive war (which restricts the food supply for much of the world via embargoes, blockades, destruction of food production).
</p>

<p>
The systems that make our modern world possible are much more fragile than we realize since everything is interconnected. All it could take is just one thing to fail for everything to fail. Recall that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Suez_Canal_obstruction">in 2021, a ship accidentally got stuck and blocked the Suez Canal for 6 days</a>. That obstruction alone <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/03/28/continued-suez-canal-problems-costs-10-billion-a-day/">caused the global economy to lose an estimated $60 billion</a>. A larger accident or disaster will have much more devastating consequences.

<p>
The people of today who are not concerned with overpopulation and ridicule Neo-Malthusianism tend to believe that overpopulation would look like the Earth&rsquo;s population and the Earth&rsquo;s resources both increasing (the latter due to technological advancements), with Earth&rsquo;s population increasing faster. Not only does this ignore the possibility that a major/unprecendented catastrophe could cause overpopulation to happen instantly, but it&rsquo;s also less likely than the catastrophe-caused scenario since a severe catastrophe could happen at any moment.
</p>

<p>
All it will take to prove that Neo-Malthusianism concerns are/were warranted is for an unprecendented emergency to happen. For example, suppose the following series of plausible geopolitical events occurs:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>China invades Taiwan,</li>
<li>The US military defends Taiwan,</li>
<li>India takes the opportunity to attack China and seize Tibet while China is distracted,</li>
<li>Japan and South Korea support Taiwan&rsquo;s defense as well in order to protect their international trading routes through the Strait of Taiwan,</li>
<li>North Korea might takes the opportunity to attack South Korea while they are distracted,</li>
<li>Every country around the world picks a side (China vs the US),</li>
<li>WWIII starts,</li>
<li>massive food shortages begin everywhere due to the disruption of free trade, and</li>
<li>the world faces unprecedented overpopulation due to all of the aforementioned.</li>
</ol>
<p>
This is a very realistic scenario, especially amid the recent rapid growth of the Chinese military and increasing Chinese aggression around Taiwan. The Russian invasion of Ukraine shouldn&rsquo;t leave the world doubting that China could follow suit and invade Taiwan whenever it chooses. If this or a similarly catastrophic scenario occurs, Neo-Malthusianism will be proven right <b>eventually</b>. Once again, History shows that overpopulation can happen unpredictably within mere months, so anyone would be incredibly naive to think that it&rsquo;s never something to worry about.
</p>

<p>
If I had to guess which resource depletion will eventually cause overpopulation first, I predict that it will be the supply of freshwater, which makes sense since water is so important for doing so many different things. If water indeed proves to be the main bottleneck to future population growth, then countries with upstream water sources (e.g. China, Ethiopia, Turkey, etc) will likely choose to keep that water to themselves at the cost of the downstream countries/regions (e.g. Southeast Asia, Egypt &amp; Sudan, Iraq &amp; Syria, etc). This will cause different regions of the Earth to experience overpopulation at different times than others.
