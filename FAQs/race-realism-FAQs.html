<h2 id="intro"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> What is Race Realism?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
<b>Race Realism</b>: Race Realism is a subcategory of Biological Realism. Being a race realist means acknowledging that:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Race is defined as &ldquo;a statistical cluster of genetic variation characterized by phenotypic similarity&rdquo;, and</li>
<li>All the genes of the various races in the world occur at different statistical frequencies for each race due to all the different evolutionary and selectionary pressures that persisted in their ancestral environments for many thousands of years, and</li>
<li>Race is often a categorization scheme for human beings based on phenotypic similarity.</li>
</ol>
<p>
That&rsquo;s it. But you have to understand what a &ldquo;statistical cluster&rdquo; is, and what that means with regards to race and genetics, as well as understanding that racial differences are continuous, not discrete like the distinction between species. [Race Realism] ≠ [Racism].

<div id="outline-container-definitions" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="definitions"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Definitions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-definitions">
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Evolution</dt><dd>The change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. Evolution is a three-step process consisting of: 1. Reproduction (to excess), 2. Variation (caused by mutations) in offspring, 3. Selection.</dd>
<dt>Biological Realism</dt><dd>The unbiased application of the implications of evolutionary reasoning onto human beings, regarding race, sex, selfishness, eugenics/dysgenics, and intrinsic violence.</dd>
<dt>Race Realism</dt><dd><a href="#intro">See the previous section.</a></dd>
<dt>Race</dt><dd>A statistical cluster of genetic variation characterized by phenotypic similarity. Races are both social constructs and useful categories for describing biological realities.</dd>
<dt>Statistical Cluster</dt><dd>A grouping of a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). For more info, see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis">Wikipedia: Cluster Analysis</a>.</dd>
<dt>Mixed-Race</dt><dd>Having genes and ancestry from multiple different races. Note that being Mixed-Race cannot be well-defined unless two or more races are defined beforehand.</dd>
<dt>Ethnicity / Ethnic Group</dt><dd>A grouping of people who identify with each other on the basis of shared attributes that distinguish them from other groups. Those attributes can include common sets of traditions, ancestry, language, history, society, culture, nation, religion, or social treatment within their residing area.</dd>
<dt>Eugenostate</dt><dd>A state that enforces Eugenic Population Control, Laissez-Faire Eugenics, and Immigration restrictions, regardless of race or ethnicity.</dd>
<dt>Ethnostate</dt><dd>An ethnonationalist state that enforces racial or ethnic homogeneity. Ethnostates could theoretically enforce eugenics policies as well, but <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/01/eugenostate-versus-ethnostate.html?view=classic">that would be harder to implement in an ethnostate for a number of reasons</a>. Ethnostates also require more complicated immigration policies than eugenostates.</dd>
<dt>Racism</dt><dd>Irrational prejudice or discrimination based upon race or ethnicity.</dd>
<dt>The West</dt><dd>Countries that have majority European populations and/or have been influenced by Western Culture, including Europe, the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. Sometimes I use this term more generally to also include Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan since those countries have also been influenced by Western culture, and have decent genetics for modernity, as far as our policy objectives are concerned.</dd>
<dt>The Great Replacement (of White People)</dt><dd>The phenomenon where white people are being replaced by foreign ethnicities within Western countries. It is very real and in several decades, it is projected to be finished by the end of the 21st century.</dd>
<dt>White Preservationism</dt><dd>A movement to combat the Great Replacement by increasing white fertility rates in the Western World. From a eugenics standpoint, the goal of white preservationism is to preserve (most of) the (good) genes of Europeans, not necessarily to preserve white people as a distinctive race. Zero Contradictions supports white preservationism.</dd>
<dt>White Supremacy</dt><dd>The racist belief that white people are superior to all other races. Zero Contradictions condemns white supremacy.</dd>
<dt>Race Denialism</dt><dd>The denial of Race Realism, either with fallacies and/or a refusal to extend the implications of evolutionary reasoning onto human beings.</dd>
<dt>Race Creationism</dt><dd>The same thing as Race Denialism, with the connotation that the belief is similar to religious dogma.</dd>
<dt>Racial Solidarity (v1)</dt><dd>Solidarity between all the members of a race with each other.</dd>
<dt>Racial Solidarity (v2)</dt><dd>Solidarity between people from different races with each other.</dd>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-jaymans-race-realism-FAQs">

<div id="outline-container-social-construct" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="social-construct"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Isn&rsquo;t Race just a social construct?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-social-construct">
<p>
Yes, but that does not constitute an argument against race realism. Rather, it is a false dichotomy: the social construct of beauty does not mean that humans look identical and that their appearance is only a product of perception. Likewise, race is a social construct built on top of a biological reality.
</p>

<p>
Framing race as nothing more than a social construct ignores that race is also a statistical cluster of genes. There are meaningful ways to categorize people into racial groups via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis">Cluster Analysis</a>, and it is valid to inquire into the differences between different human population groups. There are real differences, and that does have implications for social policy and understanding societal outcomes.
</p>

<p>
Clusters <i>can</i> be arbitrary, but there&rsquo;s also mathematical ways to create reasonable, meaningful clusters that are helpful for conveying important information. For more info, see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">Wikipedia:k-means clustering</a>
</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-pseuodo-science">
<p>
No, and this question assumes that Academia can be trusted, even though there are multiple reasons why Academia cannot be trusted:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Ideological Bias</li>
<li>Perverse Incentives</li>
<li>Social Circularity</li>
<li>Naive/Fake Empiricism</li>
<li>Statistical Manipulation (e.g. p-Hacking)</li>

If anything, the overwhelming amount of statistical evidence proves that not all races are created equally in terms of their abilities and, accomplishments, and actions.

<p>
No, if there are differences between races, then Occam&rsquo;s Razor concludes that race realism should be the null hypothesis and the simplest, default explanation for racial disparities and achievement gaps between races.

<p>
No, high intelligence would not be advantageous in all environments. That&rsquo;s an assumption.
</p>

<p>
Intelligence has costs and benefits.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>For one thing, higher intelligence requires consuming more energy, which isn&rsquo;t possible or even cost-efficient energy-wise for promoting reproductive intelligence in every environment.</li>
<li>For another thing, it is well-known that more educated people tend to have lower reproductive success, and both of those facts should be enough to make it clear that higher intelligence doesn&rsquo;t necessarily correlate with higher reproductive success in all situations.</li>
</ol>
<p>
We can observe however that increases in IQ seem to be linked to the growth of civilization: laws, money, writing, math, etc, or things that require abstract reasoning. That being said, we do have a theory of what kinds of circumstances can lead to the growth and development of civilization that is rooted in biology.
</p>

<p>
We propose that <a href="https://notetoworld.org/index.php?loc=note&amp;key=297598bb-9677-4de7-a706-44bc410aec53">some environmental circumstances are more likely to produce more complex civilizations than others</a>, and that the resulting complex civilization select for higher IQ, when they are sustained for long periods of time.

Most people are vastly unaware of just how much tribal warfare the Native Americans engaged against each since most public schools only teach the wars and conflicts between European settlers and Native Americans, so this list aims to debunk the myth that Native Americans had peaceful societies that lived off the land before the Europeans came. As always, refer to the sources cited in the Wikipedia articles for more information. Wikipedia may not be a valid source by itself, but the sources that it cites definitely are.

<li>The Iroquois engaged in wars, cannibalism, slavery, and torture with other Native Americans. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois">Source</a></li>
<li>&ldquo;A war party was considered successful if it took many prisoners without suffering losses in return; killing enemies was considered acceptable if necessary, but disapproved of as it reduced the number of potential captives. Taking captives were considered far more important than scalps. Additionally, war served as a way for young men to demonstrate their valor and courage. This was a prerequisite for a man to be made a chief, and it was also essential for men who wanted to marry. Haudenosaunee women admired warriors who were brave in war.&rdquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois">Source</a></li>

<li>&ldquo;Blackfoot war parties would ride hundreds of miles on raids&#x2026; Warriors would strive to perform various acts of bravery called counting coup, in order to move up in social rank. The coups in order of importance were: taking a gun from a living enemy and or touching him directly; capturing lances, and bows; scalping an enemy; killing an enemy; freeing a tied horse from in front of an enemy lodge; leading a war party; scouting for a war party; stealing headdresses, shields, pipes (sacred ceremonial pipes); and driving a herd of stolen horses back to camp&rdquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackfoot_Confederacy#Enemies_and_warrior_culture">Source</a></li>
<li>&ldquo;Both the Salish-Tunaxe and the Semteuse were almost &rdquo;killed off in wars&ldquo; with the Blackfoot and further reduced by smallpox. Some of the survivors took refuge among the Salish. With the near extinction of the Salish-Tunaxe, the Salish extended their hunting grounds northward to Sun River. Between 1700 and 1750, they were driven back by pedestrian Blackfoot warriors armed with fire weapons. Finally, they were forced out of the bison range and west of the divide along with the Kutenai-Tunaxe.&rdquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederated_Salish_and_Kootenai_Tribes#Forced_west_of_the_divide">Source</a></li>
<li>&ldquo;The neighbors of the western Cree were Athapascans on the north and northwest, Blackfeet on the west, and Assiniboine on the south. With the Assiniboine they were closely associated from the time of the separation of that tribe from the parent Sioux prior to the opening of the country by exploration in the early years of the seventeenth century; nevertheless, there were rather frequent drunken brawls, with consequent murders, between the two tribes in the boisterous era of the fur-trade. They joined forces in pushing the Blackfeet, Bloods, and Piegan southwestward out of the plains bordering Saskatchewan river, and up to the termination of inter-tribal warfare remained constant enemies of these other Algonquians. The Cree inheritance of the historic Sioux hostility toward the Chippewa was not lessened by the friendly reception they accorded the renegade Assiniboine, for whom the Sioux entertained bitter hatred mixed with professed contempt. The Woods Cree had little, if any, part in this warfare with the Blackfeet and the Sioux; their operations were limited to dispossessing the Athapascans of their territory between the Saskatchewan and Athabasca lake. Peace river, according to Henry, received its name from the circumstance that the Cree and the Beavers settled their hostilities at Peace point. —The North American Indian, Volume 18 (1907)&rdquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Confederacy#Early_expansion_and_the_fur_trade">Source</a></li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-race-gap-single-parents">
<p>
The rates of violent crime have been falling since the mid-1990s, in spite of a surge in single parenthood during the 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s. However, the theory that single parenthood causes criminality would predict the opposite, as it would predict an increase in violent crime following the increase in single parenthood by about 20 years. While this doesn&rsquo;t prove that single parenthood has no effect on crime rates, it&rsquo;s counter-evidence that needs to be considered, along with all the best explanations why crime rates fell during the 90s and onward.
</p>

<p>
Instead of single-parent households causing higher crime rates, it could also be the case that people who grew up in single-parent / fatherless households are simply more likely to be less responsible and commit more crime because their parents&rsquo; genes were less responsible in the first place. Correlation does not imply causation, but genetic factors shouldn&rsquo;t be ruled out in favor of environmental factors just because the former is a more taboo explanation. A child with good genes would probably perform decently well even without a father present, although they would obviously be better with a father in all cases.

<div id="outline-container-averages-and-exceptions" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="averages-and-exceptions"><span class="section-number-2">8.</span> Aren&rsquo;t there exceptionally smart people from all races?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-averages-and-exceptions">
<p>
Yes for the most part, but this does not debunk race realism. Once again, a race is a statistical cluster of genes. That means that there can be statistical outliers to any generalized claim made about a race(s). Relatively high-IQ people can come from low-IQ races, and relatively low-IQ people can come from high-IQ races, but when this happens, those people are the statistical outliers of their respective races. Race realism is the recognition of statistical tendencies that are caused by historical evolutionary patterns, not dogmatic judgments.
</p>

<p>
In fact, the possibility that statistical outliers may exist within a data set is precisely the reason why racism is irrational. Even if race A has consistently lower crime rates and consistently higher average IQs than race B, it would be dangerous to assume that that would be the case for <i>every single person</i> belonging to race A, and equally wrong to assume that <i>every single person</i> belonging to race B is going to be less intelligent or more likely to commit crimes that every single person from race A. The way how individuals should be treated should always be based on merit, not congenital demographic properties.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, even if it is the case that Amerindians and Sub-Saharan Africans commit disproportionately more crimes than Europeans, East Asians, East Indians, etc, it can simultaneously be the case that most people from those races are law-abiding and don&rsquo;t commit any crimes. Similarly, the smartest people who ever lived may have been European or East Asian, but that does not conclude that every European or East Asian is going to be a genius. Generally speaking, the people who commit crimes and the people who have built humanity&rsquo;s greatest inventions tend to be on the extreme tail ends of the normal curve(s).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-starting-tabula-rasa">
<p>
Yes, but even though everybody might be born knowing virtually nothing (see: <a href="../epistemology/tabula-rasa-eval.html">Evaluating Tabula Rasa</a>), this does not prove that all individuals have equal intellectual ability because it ignores that some races are better at learning than others. Every expert was a beginner at some point, but some people (and some races, on average) are better at becoming experts and intellectuals than others.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-races-better-than-others">
<p>
This depends on what is meant by &ldquo;better&rdquo;, and in what context. A true race realist would never say that one race is always going to better than another in every single situation, because the whole reason why races are different from each other in the first place is because they each evolved genes and traits that enhanced their ancestors&rsquo; ability to reproduce in their respective environments. For example, it is going to be easier for Sub-Saharan Africans to live near the equator than Europeans because they have genetic resistance against diseases like skin cancer and malaria. On the other hand, it&rsquo;s going to be harder for black people to live in a place like pre-Industrial Europe since they would be more prone to Vitamin D deficiency, would probably have lactose intolerance, and other factors.
</p>

<p>
If <a href="../economics/georgism-elevator-pitch.html">Georgism</a> and government-enforced EPC were implemented in order to the preserve industrial, technological civilization, then there is a consensus among race realists that Europeans and East Asians are going to be better at reproducing in the new environment <i>on average</i>, due to their higher intelligence and greater economic productivity. But that wouldn&rsquo;t mean that Asians and Europeans would always be better than all the other races in <i>all</i> situations. Moreover, if the <a href="./EPC-FAQs.html">eugenostate that we support</a> did exist, it could not forbid anybody who meets all of the <a href="./EPC-FAQs.html#reproduction-license-reqs">listed requirements</a> from having children, no exceptions.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, even if it were the case that one race was always &ldquo;better&rdquo; than the others, that still would not be good grounds to treat people differently based on nothing but their race because we already explained that <a href="#averages-and-exceptions">there are statistical outliers for every race</a>.

<div id="outline-container-racial-preferences" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="racial-preferences"><span class="section-number-3">9.1.</span> But having a preference to be around people of one&rsquo;s own race is normal and natural.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-racial-preferences">
<p>
This is true, and it&rsquo;s also true that racially homogeneous societies tend to perform better and have fewer social problems than racially diverse societies. But the facts are that: 1. we live in an increasingly globalized world where racial differences are declining, 2. globalization makes race-mixing inevitable and it requires different races to interact with each other. If humanity is to sustain a technologically prosperous world, then globalization is a must, and so is cooperation between various races. If given the choice, most people will choose modern society over primitive society.
</p>

<p>
Preferring one&rsquo;s own race was almost certainly conferred a evolutionary advantages in pre-modern times, but racism and racial separation are simply not compatible with modern civilization. If one wishes to be successful in the modern world, it&rsquo;s more rational to cooperate with people of all races instead. We&rsquo;re all human after all.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-not-racists-nazis-supremacists">
<p>
The short answer is: No.
</p>

<p>
I for one, am a race realist who believes that people should be judged not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. The next few subsections elaborate on this and why there is nothing contradictory about being a race realist and non-racist.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-not-racist" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="not-racist"><span class="section-number-3">10.1.</span> Race realism does not imply racism.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-not-racist">
<p>
There are many race realists who are not racist (including myself), especially if they are in favor of a eugenostate instead of an ethnostate. A Eugenostate would treat all races equally under the law, but there would be competition regarding who is authorized to reproduce who is forbidden. So while it would be inevitable that some races would be more reproductively successful than others under a eugenostate, there would be legal limitations on people from any race from being able to have children. Eugenostates value equal opportunities, not equality of outcomes.
</p>

<p>
Non-racist race-realists do not advocate that some races be given greater legal privileges than other races. We believe that all people from any race should be entitled to the same legal rights as anyone else. Racism is for the most part and in most cases, a form of irrational discrimination.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I&rsquo;ve found that it tends to be the case most racists and race idealists have accomplished so little in the real world, that the only thing left that they have to be proud of is their race, because without that, they would have no pride at all.

</p>

<p>
Race Realism is about acknowledging that every race has genes that made them more reproductively successful in their ancestral environments. But now that we live in modernity, the statistical evidence makes it abundantly clear that some races are better adapted to modernity than others (on average).

There&rsquo;s definitely many, many more genetic differences and examples of race realism than what are shown on this inexhaustive list. With so many examples showing how different human populations evolved different adaptations to become more physically fit in their environments, how could anyone reasonably deny that there weren&rsquo;t also different mental traits that evolved for different mental populations as well?

<h2 id="racists"><span class="section-number-2">12.</span> If race realists don&rsquo;t necessarily have to be racist, then why are so many of them racist?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-racists">
<p>
The first half of the answer to this question has to do with memetics and how ideologies evolve over time. As explained in the essay, <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-rise-and-fall-of-alt-right.html?view=classic">The Rise and Fall of the Alt-Right</a>, the Alt-Right started out as an intellectual movement, but then it degenerated into a <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-communists-who-took-power-in.html?view=classic">Utopian Ideology</a> that got dumber and dumber since ideologies need to tap into human emotions in order to propagate most effectively. Since the ideology started spreading via emotions instead of reason, this caused all sorts of purity spiraling where the leaders and members of the movement started promoting more extremist and less rational ideas in an attempt to claim status over other members of the movement. <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/07/status-pyramid-schemes.html?view=classic">This other post &ldquo;Status Pyramid Schemes&rdquo;</a> talks more about how that process and the evolution of memetic ideologies works in general.
</p>

<p>
Race realists like myself don&rsquo;t want a movement that is driven by emotions and deplorable claims to status. We want an ideology that is supported by reason and scientific evidence. We do have some ideas about how to start a philosophical movement that includes race realism without devolving into a virtue-signaling contest, but that will be a post for another time.
</p>

<p>
The second reason why so many race realists tend to be racist is that racist people are more likely to support the idea of race realism, except that they don&rsquo;t have the intellectual or the bio-evolutionary understanding for the tenants of race realism. I <i>refuse</i> to associate with those kinds of people since they are anti-intellectual, believe in unequal rights, and do not have similar goals.

<div id="outline-container-race-mixing" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="race-mixing"><span class="section-number-2">13.</span> Are race realists against race-mixing?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-race-mixing">
<p>
No. I have mentioned on this page that I am mixed-race. It is true that most racists are against race-mixing to some degree, but as I have already written in this FAQ, racism is not the same thing as race realism. Some race realists are against race-mixing (e.g. Payton S. Gendron, the 2022 Buffalo shooter), but that is mainly because they don&rsquo;t understand that race-mixing is inevitable.
</p>

<p>
In fact, if you go back far enough in history, everybody living today is &ldquo;mixed-race&rdquo; in a sense, and race-mixing was an important part of human evolution. Modern humans were formed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interbreeding_between_archaic_and_modern_humans">interbreeding between homo sapiens, neanderthals, and denisovans</a>, to varying degrees for all the races of the world. And that doesn&rsquo;t even include all the races that have mixed, merged, split, appeared, or disappeared since then for all kinds of complicated historical and geographical reasons.
</p>

<p>
A potential disadvantage to race mixing on a global scale could be that populations around the world would become less adapted to their environments, which could cause some concern in some areas, but none of these possible concerns will matter much in the modern world. Some examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Immune Response: Immune systems are tend to be adapted to local conditions, parasites, and diet. However, conditions in the modern world conditions are completely different than they are from the past: parasites are either gone or global, and diet is totally different and globalized. So this doesn&rsquo;t matter much, as far as race-mixing is concerned.</li>
<li>Organ Donation: Organ transplants tend to have greater compatibility with recipients people of the same race as the donor. But as the world continues to race mix more and more, this will become less of a problem over time, if it&rsquo;s a problem at all.</li>
<li>Giving Birth: Mixed-race babies offspring are more prone to having failed deliveries in some cases, but this doesn&rsquo;t matter much either. It&rsquo;s a known fact that babies with genes that cause them to require C-sections to be delivered are becoming more and more common in the modern world, so even if race-mixing causes this to be a slight problem, it&rsquo;s as much of a problem as how the prevalence of C-sections have been increasing. Again, this isn&rsquo;t really a huge problem to worry about, compared to the problems that we have that already exist.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For most traits, race won&rsquo;t matter when you take the parent&rsquo;s traits into account. Good looking parents have good looking children, smart parents have smart children, and tall parents have tall children.
</p>

<p>
With all that being said, I have only ever encountered one rational argument against race-mixing. Should you find yourself in a situation where you can reasonably expect your children to face significant discrimination for being mixed-race, it may be better for your children to avoid breeding with another race if you can. But once again, this won&rsquo;t matter much tolerance for other races continues to increase. And it definitely won&rsquo;t be a problem in the long run if racial differences are destined to continue disappearing and humanity&rsquo;s racial admixture collapses into a single, globalized race.

<h2 id="ethnostate"><span class="section-number-2">14.</span> Do race realists want to construct an ethnostate?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-ethnostate">
<p>
No, we want to construct a eugenostate, not an ethnostate. Anyone who supports an ethnostate instead of a eugenostate has a flawed understanding of what race actually is, and does not understand that some degree of race-mixing is inevitable. For a summary why, see: <a href="./EPC-FAQs.html#no-ethnostate">Does supporting Eugenics entail creating an Ethnostate?</a>

<div id="outline-container-why-race-realism-matters" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="why-race-realism-matters"><span class="section-number-2">16.</span> Why does it matter that people come to terms with race realism?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why-race-realism-matters">
<p>
Because race realism is <a href="#environmental-factors">the best explanation</a> for differences in crime rates, academic achievement, and success between different races in the modern world. If we completely rule out the best explanation, we deny the influence of biology on human outcomes, and we make it evil to challenge the Left&rsquo;s denial of biology, then the Left has free reign to come up with all sorts of insane, ridiculous, and racist anti-white conspiracy theories and explanations to account for the achievement gaps between races. These mistaken beliefs motivate the Left to pursue &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; to the achievement gaps that involve dismantling meritocracy and thwarting criminal justice at every opportunity with extreme zeal and steady progress. This is really bad if civilization is to have a decent future.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if people can be convinced that the racial outcome gaps are caused by genetic differences instead of environment factors, then people will stop believing in hidden forces and conspiracies. The result is that meritocracy and criminal justice will be preserved, instead of dismantled in the name of &ldquo;racial equality&rdquo;. If we want to preserve civilization, then we need millions of people to come to terms with biological realism. It&rsquo;s the truth.
</p>

<p>
TL;DR: Accepting race realism eliminates the justification for many of the detrimental social policies in the West, from &ldquo;anti-racism&rdquo; to mass immigration.

<div id="outline-container-great-replacement" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="great-replacement"><span class="section-number-2">17.</span> Isn&rsquo;t The Great Replacement Of White People Just A Myth?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-great-replacement">
<p>
No, not at all. The people who are claiming that the Great Replacement Theory is just a myth are following the typical leftist tactic of denying that something bad is happening, but if it is happening, then it&rsquo;s actually a good thing. Anybody who claims the Great Replacement is a myth is a liar, and I say that as someone who is less European than the average American (as of 2023).
</p>

<p>
Statistics consistently show that countries with historically European populations are becoming less and less European. This trend has been happening for decades. People can pretend that this isn&rsquo;t a problem or that it won&rsquo;t lead to the perishing of white people all they want, but it is undeniable that if the trend continues for several decades, white people will be replaced by other races by and large, unless something happens to reverse the trend and increase the fertility levels of white people.

The first thing that we should do to prevent the Great Replacement is to tighten immigration into Western Countries. We already have limited resources, so there is no reason to allow more than a trickle of useful immigrants into the West.

I define White Preservationism as: A movement to combat the Great Replacement by increasing white fertility rates in the Western World. To me, the goal of white preservationism should be to preserve (most of) the (good) genes of Europeans, not necessarily to preserve white people as a distinctive race.
</p>

<p>
Some people might argue that white preservationism is best achieved with an ethnostate, but I don&rsquo;t see any reason why that should be necessary if the fertility rates of white people were increased in general. I don&rsquo;t care about preserving distinctive races since I&rsquo;m more interested in having a population with eugenic qualities, since race mixing is inevitable anyway.
