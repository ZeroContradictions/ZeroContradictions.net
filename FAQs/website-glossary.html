<h2 id="intro"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Why I&rsquo;m Writing This Glossary</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
In my opinion, the term &ldquo;virtue-signaling&rdquo; should&rsquo;ve been first coined by Ted Kaczynski, and it&rsquo;s a shame that he wasn&rsquo;t the one to invent the term. He had a golden opportunity to invent the term and become known for inventing it when he was addressing it in his 1995 manifesto &ldquo;Industrial Society and Its Future&rdquo;. He repeatedly wrote in the manifesto that he just couldn&rsquo;t think of a better term to describe what he was trying to talk about. Kaczynski hit the nail on the hammer that [virtue signaling] is largely a result of the Power Process being disrupted in industrial-technological society, but unfortunately he referred to &ldquo;virtue signaling&rdquo; as &ldquo;leftism&rdquo; in his manifesto since the term had not been invented yet and he hadn&rsquo;t thought of it. This naturally drew a lot of criticism from leftists, but it would have drawn less hostile criticism if he would have been the first to coin the neologism, especially since it would&rsquo;ve communicated a more specific meaning and would&rsquo;ve been more easily differentiable as a different concept.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Richard Dawkins coined the term &ldquo;meme&rdquo; so that he could better describe a new field of knowledge that is related to evolution and biology, and he gained a lot of fame since he was the first person to invent the neologism and use it to communicate a very important and interesting phenomenon for describing how the world works.
</p>

<p>
There is a lot I could say about semantic fields and how the invention of new words for specific concepts leads to faster neurological retrieval of those concepts, but writing about it would overwhelm me at the moment. By coining my own neologisms, it will help to popularize this blog since it will gain more notoriety for being the first or among the first sources to have ever used the term, if it catches on in popular language.
</p>

<p>
Many of the terms defined on this webpage were not invented by myself, but they are displayed here anyway for quick reference, and so that newcomers to this website can learn its jargon quickly.
</p>

<p>
Another main reason why I am defining all the terminology that this website uses is so to avoid having the <a href="../language/sapir-whorf-theory">Sapir-Whorf Effect</a> get applied to my writings, lest what I&rsquo;m saying is more likely to be misinterpreted to mean things other than what I intended.

<dt>Rationalized</dt><dd>Attempting to make something seem reasonable, even if actually isn&rsquo;t. This term can be applied to both metaphysics/epistemology or ethical / political philosophy, and while it can always describe someone&rsquo;s attitude or actions towards facts about the former, it seems less applicable to apply it to people&rsquo;s ethical or political opinions since morality is subjective, and most of the time when people do rationalize their ethical or political opinions, it is typically done in an attempt to justify oneself according to the Law of Egoism, in which case self-justification or self-rationalization may be better terms.</dd>
<dt>Self-Justification / Self-Rationalization</dt><dd>The psychological tendency for life to justify its own existence, beliefs, and actions for the sake of its own continued existence, even if their beliefs are wrong, their existence doesn&rsquo;t accomplish anything meaningful according to rational beings, and their actions work against post-moral cooperation ethics.</dd>

<dt>Materialism (Metaphysics)</dt><dd>i</dd>
<dt>Cause and Effect</dt><dd>i</dd>
<dt>Determinism</dt><dd>The doctrine that events are determined completely by previously existing causes.</dd>
<dt>Causality</dt><dd>The phenomenon where one event, process, state, or object (<i>a cause</i>) contributes to the production of another event, process, state, or object (<i>an effect</i>) where the cause is partly responsible for the effect, and the effect is partly dependent on the cause. Causality is built into the way humans think, so it&rsquo;s an inescapable aspect of the human condition.</dd>
<dt>Metaphysical Free Will (MFW)</dt><dd>The doctrine that agents are able to make decisions independently of external factors. MFW is false.</dd>
<dt>Hard Determinism</dt><dd>The doctrine that <i>all</i> events, including human action, are ultimately determined by causes external to the will of agents. In other words, Determinism is true, and MFW is false. Since Zero Contradictions argues that MFW is false, Hard Determinism is effectively the same thing as Determinism.</dd>
<dt>Libertarian Free Will (LFW)</dt><dd>Determinism does not exist. LFW is the exact opposition of Hard Determinism. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism_(metaphysics)">Libertarian Free Will</a> does not exist in reality, and <a href="../epistemology/free-will#determinism-vs-free-will">it is easily disproven</a>.</dd>
<dt>Compatibilism</dt><dd>The doctrine that Determinism and Metaphysical Free Will both coexist. Whether or not this is true depends on how the terms are defined.</dd>
<dt>Subject-Object Compatibilism</dt><dd>The doctrine that Determinism and Metaphysical Free Will both coexist according to the subject-object dichotomy.</dd>
<dt>Incompatibilism</dt><dd>The doctrine that Determinism and Metaphysical Free Will <i>cannot</i> coexist. Incompatibilism may be either Hard Determinism or Libertarianism.</dd>
<dt>Epistemic Free Will (EFW)</dt><dd>The ability of a subject to <i>consciously choose</i> to do what it wants, regardless of whether it can actually fulfill its desires or not, and also regardless of whether Determinism is true or false.</dd>
<dt>Agency</dt><dd>The satisfaction of two conditions that: 1. a subject can choose to do as it wants, and 2. it is able to do it within its current circumstances. Since being conscious is a requirement in order to be &rsquo;capable&rsquo; of doing something, Agency has to be conscious by definition.</dd>
<dt>Power</dt><dd>Essentially, the same thing as agency. The key difference is that agency emphasizes internal processes while power emphasizes external processes.</dd>
<dt>Desire</dt><dd>To want something. Desire is a precursor to Epistemic Free Will because Desires are necessary for Values to exist. <i>All</i> sentient organisms have desires.</dd>
<dt>Volition</dt><dd>The same thing as Epistemic Free Will (EFW).</dd>
<dt>Spatio-Temporal Envelope</dt><dd>i</dd>
<dt>Cultural Education/Indoctrination/Instillation/&#x2026;</dt><dd>i</dd>
<dt>Subject (philosophy)</dt><dd>A being who has a unique consciousness (will and awareness) and/or unique personal experiences, or an entity that has a relationship with another entity that exists outside itself (an object).</dd>
<dt>Object (philosophy)</dt><dd>A philosophical term often used in contrast to the term <i>subject</i>. A subject is an observer and an object is a thing observed.</dd>
<dt>Subject-Object Dichotomy</dt><dd>A categorization system for understanding different perspectives as a subject or object. It is the resolution to most philosophical problems.</dd>
<dt>Materialism</dt><dd>A form of philosophical monism which holds that matter is the fundamental substance in nature, and that all things, including mental states and consciousness, are results of material interactions of material/objective things.</dd>
<dt>Physicalism</dt><dd>The view that all that exists is ultimately physical. It is arguably the same thing as materialism.</dd>

<dt>Race Realism</dt><dd>A subcategory of Biological Realism. The acknowledgment that: 1. Race is defined as &ldquo;a statistical cluster of genetic variation characterized by phenotypic similarity&rdquo;, and 2. All the genes of the various races in the world occur at different statistical frequencies for each race due to all the different evolutionary and selectionary pressures that persisted in their ancestral environments for many thousands of years, and 3.

<dt>Malthusianism</dt><dd>The theory that potentially exponential population growth can surpass the linear growth of an environment&rsquo;s carrying capacity (including its food supply and other resources), which eventually causes members of the population to die off until settling back down to the carrying capacity.</dd>
<dt>Neo-Malthusianism</dt><dd>The theory and concern that overpopulation (and overconsumption) may increase resource depletion and/or environmental degradation and lead to ecological collapse or other hazards.

<dt>Carrying Capacity</dt><dd>The maximum population size of a biological species that can be sustained by that specific environment, given the food, habitat, water, and other resources available.</dd>
<dt>Population Buffer Space (PBS)</dt><dd>The estimated difference between the Carrying Capacity and the LMPL.</dd>
<dt>Legal Maximum Population Limit (LMPL)</dt><dd>The maximum population limit of the society that the population must avoid exceeding, in the interest of avoiding an Overpopulation Crisis, as set by a eugenostate. The LMPL is always lower than the Carrying Capacity, with the Population Buffer Space being the quantitative difference between them. The LMPL is meant to be a target population the society should stay below, but if the population does rise above it, the Population Buffer Space gives the eugenostate some flexibility, as it still avoids exceeding the Carrying Capacity.</dd>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Eugenics</dt><dd>The improvement of genetic qualities through selection, to make people/organisms more adaptive to their relative environments. What is considered &ldquo;Eugenic&rdquo; is always relative to a given environment, but when the term is used, it&rsquo;s usually assumed that the environment in question is Modernity. In simpler words, Eugenics just means selecting for traits that we value in other human beings, traits such as intelligence and responsibility.</dd>
<dt>Dysgenics</dt><dd>The opposite of eugenics. The accumulation of traits that make people/organisms <i>less</i> adaptive to their environments, thus resulting in Evolutionary Mismatch. Dysgenics usually arises when selectionary pressures are removed.</dd>
<dt>Evolutionary Mismatch</dt><dd>When evolved traits that were once advantageous become maladaptive due to changes in the environment. As it relates to humans, nearly all the evolutionary mismatch in the modern world is caused by rapid technological advancements that occurred during the Industrial Revolution. See: <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2013/10/caterpillars-and-philosophy.html">Catepillars and Philosophy</a>.</dd>
<dt>Dirigiste (Top-down) &ldquo;Eugenics&rdquo;</dt><dd>The supposed improvement of human hereditary qualities through overly selective breeding, thus causing a dramatic reduction in genetic diversity. It can be done by either positive eugenics or negative eugenics. Ironically, top-down &ldquo;eugenics&rdquo; would actually make people less adaptive to their environments, hence why the term is used with quotes.</dd>
<dt>Laissez-Faire (Bottom-up) Eugenics</dt><dd>The improvement of human hereditary qualities by requiring reproduction licenses (which have minimal requirements) in order for people to have children. Laissez-Faire Eugenics during Modernity would be the re-introduction of reasonable selectionary pressures on the human genome.</dd>
<dt>Positive Eugenics</dt><dd>Encouraging or subsidizing people with good genetic qualities to reproduce more.</dd>
<dt>Negative Eugenics</dt><dd>Preventing or discouraging people with bad genetic qualities from reproducing.</dd>
<dt>Eugenostate</dt><dd>A state that enforces Eugenic Population Control, Laissez-Faire Eugenics, and Immigration restrictions, regardless of race or ethnicity.</dd>
<dt>Racism</dt><dd>Irrational prejudice or discrimination based upon race or ethnicity.</dd>
<dt>Reproduction License</dt><dd>A legal document that affirms that the citizen who possesses the title is legally authorized to have X number of children, given that they meet the legal requirements and have paid for the license.</dd>
<dt>Georgism</dt><dd>An economic philosophy stating that natural resources belong equally to all. It achieves this by placing a single tax on the value of natural resources, which pays for all government expenses. <a href="../civilization/georgism-crash-course">See this page for more info</a>.</dd>
<dt>The West</dt><dd>Countries that have majority European populations and/or have been influenced by Western Culture, including Europe, the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. Sometimes I use this term more generally to also include Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan since those countries have also been influenced by Western culture, and have decent genetics for modernity, as far as our policy objectives are concerned.</dd>
<dt>Westernized</dt><dd>Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and other countries that have been significantly influenced by Western culture. These countries also have similar values to Western countries and decent genetics for modernity, as far as our policy objectives are concerned.</dd>
<dt>The Great Replacement (of White People)</dt><dd>The phenomenon where white people are being replaced by foreign ethnicities within Western countries. It is very real and in several decades, it is projected to be finished by the end of the 21st century.</dd>
<dt>White Preservationism</dt><dd>A movement to counter the Great Replacement by increasing white fertility rates in the Western World. From a eugenics standpoint, the goal of white preservationism is to preserve (most of) the (good) genes of Europeans, not necessarily to preserve white people as a distinctive race.</dd>
<dt>White Nationalism</dt><dd>An ideology that promotes ethnostates for white people, perhaps as a way to support white preservationism.</dd>
<dt>White Supremacy</dt><dd>The racist belief that white people are superior to all other races.</dd>
<dt>Ethnostate (v1)</dt><dd>A country populated by, or dominated by the interests of, a single racial or ethnic group.</dd>
<dt>Ethnostate (v2)</dt><dd>A sovereign state of which citizenship is restricted to members of a particular racial or ethnic group.</dd>
<dt>Ethnostate (v3)</dt><dd>An ethnonationalist state that enforces racial or ethnic homogeneity.</dd>
<dt>Ethnocracy</dt><dd>The same thing as an ethnostate, except there doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be a single ethnic group that populates the majority of the country.</dd>
<dt>White Supremacy</dt><dd>The racist belief that white people are superior to all other races.</dd>
<dt>Race Denialism</dt><dd>The denial of Race Realism, either with fallacies and/or a refusal to extend the implications of evolutionary reasoning onto human beings.</dd>
<dt>Race Creationism</dt><dd>The same thing as Race Denialism, with the connotation that the belief is similar to religious dogma.</dd>
<dt>Biological Denialism</dt><dd>The denial of Biological Realism, either with fallacies and/or a refusal to extend the implications of evolutionary reasoning onto human beings (and perhaps other animals too).</dd>
<dt>Sex Denialism</dt><dd>A form of biological denialism that denies innate sexual differences.</dd>
<dt>Racial Solidarity (v1)</dt><dd>Solidarity between all the members of a race with each other.</dd>

Note that &ldquo;morality&rdquo; has <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/morality#English">many different definitions</a>, so it is highly vulnerable to the <a href="../language/sapir-whorf-theory">Sapir-Whorf Effect</a>.</dd>
<dt>Morality (colloquial)</dt><dd>The intersubjective consensus (within some group of people) of &ldquo;right&rdquo; and &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;, usually formed according to the collective values.</dd>
<dt>Morality (platonic)</dt><dd>The conception that morality has a platonic realm that everybody should try to follow. This does not exist in reality.</dd>
<dt>Post-Overton</dt><dd>The philosophical position that game theory, the intrinsic selfishness of life, and <a href="../FAQs/post-overton-FAQs#memetics">memetics</a> are the best way to understand morality. It is similar to moral relativism since it posits that morality can only be based on subjective values (which are perspective-dependent), but it&rsquo;s different since it also embraces the game-theoretic assumptions of selfishness and rationality, as well as the <a href="../FAQs/post-overton-FAQs#when-life-becomes-zero-sum">zero-sum nature of life</a>. Post-overtons believe that the only legitimate rights are legal rights.</dd>
<dt>Post-Moralism</dt><dd>The same thing as Post-Overton, but with a different name.</dd>
<dt>Amoralism</dt><dd>i</dd>
<dt>Moral Objectivism</dt><dd>i</dd>
<dt>Moral Relativism</dt><dd>i</dd>
<dt>Moral Nihilism</dt><dd>i</dd>
<dt>Moral Realism</dt><dd>i</dd>
<dt>Good</dt><dd>i</dd>
<dt>Evil</dt><dd>i</dd>
<dt>Selfishness</dt><dd>Acting for your own benefit, regardless of others.</dd>
<dt>Altruism</dt><dd>Acting for the benefit of other, at some cost to oneself.</dd>
<dt>Cynicalism</dt><dd>Selfishness, except that you take what you can, and give nothing back. A cynical person does not use a moral accounting system, nor are they interested in cooperating during a prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>NOTE: I am aware that I am defining Cynicalism in a non-standard way, but I am doing so because I feel that the most common definition of &ldquo;Cynicalism&rdquo; is too closely related to the definition for &ldquo;Selfishness&rdquo;, and I feel that &ldquo;Cynicalism&rdquo; would be better used to convey a shade of meaning that most people tend to mistakenly associate with the headword &ldquo;Selfishness&rdquo;. By explicitly defining &ldquo;Selfishness&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cynicalism&rdquo;, I can contrast the two definitions to show what &ldquo;Selfishness&rdquo; is not what most people think it is.</li>
</ul></dd>
<dt>Moral Accounting System (MAS)</dt><dd>The system of emotions in a human&rsquo;s brain (and some other species&rsquo; brains too) that motivates people to do give-and-take behavior, or exchanges of labor. Evolution caused the MAS to develop in humans since they are more reproductively successful when they engage in give and take behavior within human tribes. The MAS is the primary reason why people are not <b>cynical</b>, and the behavior that MASs encourage does not count as &ldquo;reciprocal altruism&rdquo; since &ldquo;reciprocal altruism&rdquo; is an oxymoron.</dd>
<dt>Collaboration/Cooperation</dt><dd>When rational individuals work together for mutual benefit. When people are collaborating, the group is <b>never</b> places above the individuals for the sake of the group. Cooperation requires trust (the expectation of reciprocity), and every individual who <b>collaborates</b> does so with the expectation that they will get something in return.</dd>
<dt>Individualism</dt><dd>i</dd>
<dt>Collectivism</dt><dd>When individuals place the collective above the individual for the sake of the collective.</dd>
<dt>Utopian Ideology</dt><dd>Any naive ideology that people will believe in order to claim moral superiority and maintain the illusion of knowledge. <b>Utopian Ideologies</b> typically use the <b>Rhetoric of Exploitation</b>, simple-minded worldviews, moral narratives, visionary fantasies, and effective memetic propagations to delude people and spread the ideology.

<dt>The Rhetoric of Exploitation</dt><dd>A Classic Tactic used by Utopian Ideologists to replace rationalist thinking with rhetoric and self-righteous nonsense. The key is to use selective metaphors and phrases and portray the &ldquo;oppressors&rdquo; as having agency and the &ldquo;victims&rdquo; as having no agency.

<dt>Unimproved Value of Land</dt><dd>This is a somewhat misleading term, so I recommend to avoid using it whenever possible. When people use this term, they&rsquo;re usually referring to the location value of a parcel of land, plus whatever natural resources the land itself might have. The term is misleading because Location Value includes the value that the land gains from improvements to the surrounding land, but not improvements to the land parcel that is in question itself.</dd>
<dt>Property Tax</dt><dd>Taxes on real estate, including both the land and improvements to the land (e.g. buildings, structures, etc). A property tax is a combination of a good tax that increases productivity (LVT) and a bad tax that reduces productivity (taxes improvements to the land).</dd>
