<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Eugenics</dt><dd>The improvement of genetic qualities through selection, to make people/organisms more adaptive to their relative environments. What is considered &ldquo;Eugenic&rdquo; is always relative to a given environment, but when the term is used, it&rsquo;s usually assumed that the environment in question is Modernity. In simpler words, Eugenics just means selecting for traits that we value in other human beings, traits such as intelligence and responsibility.</dd>
<dt>Dysgenics</dt><dd>The opposite of eugenics. The accumulation of traits that make people/organisms <i>less</i> adaptive to their environments, thus resulting in Evolutionary Mismatch. Dysgenics usually arises when selectionary pressures are removed.</dd>
<dt>Evolutionary Mismatch</dt><dd>When evolved traits that were once advantageous become maladaptive due to changes in the environment. As it relates to humans, nearly all the evolutionary mismatch in the modern world is caused by rapid technological advancements that occurred during the Industrial Revolution. See: <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2013/10/caterpillars-and-philosophy.html?view=classic">Catepillars and Philosophy</a>.</dd>
<dt>Dirigiste (Top-down) &ldquo;Eugenics&rdquo;</dt><dd>The supposed improvement of human hereditary qualities through overly selective breeding, thus causing a dramatic reduction in genetic diversity. It can be done by either positive eugenics or negative eugenics. Ironically, top-down &ldquo;eugenics&rdquo; would actually make people less adaptive to their environments, hence why the term is used with quotes.</dd>
<dt>Laissez-Faire (Bottom-up) Eugenics</dt><dd>The improvement of human hereditary qualities by requiring reproduction licenses (which have minimal requirements) in order for people to have children. Laissez-Faire Eugenics during Modernity would be the re-introduction of reasonable selectionary pressures on the human genome.</dd>
<dt>Positive Eugenics</dt><dd>Encouraging or subsidizing people with good genetic qualities to reproduce more.</dd>
<dt>Negative Eugenics</dt><dd>Preventing or discouraging people with bad genetic qualities from reproducing.</dd>
<dt>Eugenostate</dt><dd>A state that enforces Eugenic Population Control, Laissez-Faire Eugenics, and Immigration restrictions, regardless of race or ethnicity.</dd>
<dt>Ethnostate</dt><dd>An ethnonationalist state that enforces racial or ethnic homogeneity. Ethnostates could theoretically enforce eugenics policies as well, but <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/01/eugenostate-versus-ethnostate.html?view=classic">that would be harder to implement in an ethnostate for a number of reasons</a>. Ethnostates also require more complicated immigration policies than eugenostates.</dd>
<dt>Geostate</dt><dd>A state with a Georgist economic policy and taxation system.</dd>
<dt>Welfare State</dt><dd>A state that provides welfare by taxing productive citizens in order to subsidize unproductive citizens. Welfare states have dysgenic and unsustainable practices.</dd>
<dt>Racism</dt><dd>Irrational prejudice or discrimination based upon race or ethnicity.</dd>
<dt>Reproduction License</dt><dd>A legal document that affirms that the citizen who possesses the title is legally authorized to have X number of children, given that they meet the legal requirements and have paid for the license.</dd>
<dt>Georgism</dt><dd>An economic philosophy stating that things found in nature, most importantly land, belong equally to all. It is usually associated with the idea of a single tax on the value of land and natural resources. See: <a href="../economics/georgism-elevator-pitch.html">this page for more info</a>.</dd>
<dt>The West</dt><dd>Countries that have majority European populations and/or have been influenced by Western Culture, including Europe, the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. Sometimes I use this term more generally to also include Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan since those countries have also been influenced by Western culture, and have decent genetics for modernity, as far as our policy objectives are concerned.</dd>
<dt>The Great Replacement (of White People)</dt><dd>The phenomenon where white people are being replaced by foreign ethnicities within Western countries. It is very real and in several decades, it is projected to be finished by the end of the 21st century.</dd>
<dt>White Preservationism</dt><dd>A movement to combat the Great Replacement by increasing white fertility rates in the Western World. From a eugenics standpoint, the goal of white preservationism is to preserve (most of) the (good) genes of Europeans, not necessarily to preserve white people as a distinctive race. Zero Contradictions supports white preservationism.</dd>
<dt>White Supremacy</dt><dd>The racist belief that white people are superior to all other races. Zero Contradictions condemns white supremacy.</dd>
<dt>Malthusianism</dt><dd>The theory that potentially exponential population growth can surpass the linear growth of an environment&rsquo;s carrying capacity (including its food supply and other resources), which eventually causes members of the population to die off until settling back down to the carrying capacity.</dd>
<dt>Neo-Malthusianism</dt><dd>The theory and concern that overpopulation (and overconsumption) may increase resource depletion and/or environmental degradation and lead to ecological collapse or other hazards. Neo-Malthusianism is often coupled with advocacy of human population planning to ensure sufficient resources for current and future human populations as well as for other species.</dd>
<dt>Cornucopianism</dt><dd>The pseudo-scientific theory that overpopulation, overconsumption, and environmental problems faced by society either do not exist or can be solved by technology and/or the free market.</dd>
<dt>Overpopulation</dt><dd>An excessive number of occupants (people, animals, plants, etc.) in a particular area; specifically, when the number of occupants exceeds the ability of that area to provide for them.</dd>
<dt>War, Disease, and Famine</dt><dd>The main traditional ways how overpopulation have historically been solved in human societies. The vast majority of deaths throughout human history can be attributed to War, Disease, and Famine.</dd>
<dt>Birth Control / Contraception</dt><dd>The main force of population control in Modernity. Birth Control is responsible for causing countries all over the world to have below replacement fertility rates, temporarily in the grand scheme of things.</dd>
<dt>Population Control</dt><dd>The practice of preventing the size of a population from growing past the carrying capacity, in the interest of avoiding an Overpopulation Crisis. For humans specifically, population control must be done by either artificially via Birth Control (and immigration restrictions), or naturally via War, Disease, and Famine.</dd>
<dt>Eugenic Population Control (EPC)</dt><dd>Population Control via mandatory Birth Control and (Laissez-Faire) Eugenics via Reproduction Licenses.</dd>
<dt>Overpopulation Crisis</dt><dd>When the carrying capacity is so high above the carrying capacity, that War, Disease, and Famine start to occur.</dd>
<dt>Carrying Capacity</dt><dd>The maximum population size of a biological species that can be sustained by that specific environment, given the food, habitat, water, and other resources available.</dd>
<dt>Population Buffer Space (PBS)</dt><dd>The estimated difference between the Carrying Capacity and the LMPL.</dd>
<dt>Legal Maximum Population Limit (LMPL)</dt><dd>The maximum population limit of the society that the population must avoid exceeding, in the interest of avoiding an Overpopulation Crisis, as set by a eugenostate. The LMPL is always lower than the Carrying Capacity, with the Population Buffer Space being the quantitative difference between them. The LMPL is meant to be a target population the society should stay below, but if the population does rise above it, the Population Buffer Space gives the eugenostate some flexibility, as it still avoids exceeding the Carrying Capacity.</dd>

<h2 id="what-is-eugenics"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> What is Eugenics?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what-is-eugenics">
<p>
Eugenics is the improvement of genetic qualities through selection, to make people/organisms more adaptive to their relative environments. What is considered &ldquo;Eugenic&rdquo; is always relative to a given environment, but when the term is used, it&rsquo;s usually assumed that the environment in question is Modernity. In simpler words, Eugenics just means selecting for traits that we value in other human beings, traits such as intelligence and responsibility. No matter what we do, the social environment places selective pressures on the human genome. Eugenics means that we consciously choose to select for traits that make people better members of society.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-eugenics-in-modern-society">
<p>
It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that in several ways, there is already popular support for some widely practiced and commonly accepted forms of Eugenics in modern society. Those instances just aren&rsquo;t called Eugenics when they occur. Some examples include: aborting fetuses that have severe birth defects, outlawing incest between close relatives, <a href="https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2015/05/eugenics-ready/">replacing defective mitochondrial DNA in some children conceived via IVF</a>, and how some sperm and egg banks prohibit donations from people who have ADHD, ASD, or do not meet certain height requirements. I support all those instances of eugenics, except for the last one, which I explain here: <a href="#why-laissez-faire-is-best">Why Laissez-Faire Eugenics is the best</a>.

<h2 id="why-implement-eugenics"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Why do you want to implement Eugenics? How is dysgenics a threat to humanity? Wouldn&rsquo;t humanity be better off without eugenics?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why-implement-eugenics">
<p>
A better question would be: Why shouldn&rsquo;t we implement eugenics? We live in a time where there is unprecedented evolutionary mismatch between the people living in society, and the modern environment that we humans have created using technology and industrialization. Biological evolution is slower than cultural evolution and humans evolve more slowly than pathogens.
</p>

<p>
The only ways to solve the evolutionary mismatch facing us today are: 1. get rid of modern civilization, or 2. eugenics. And we argue that the latter is far more preferable than the former. Either we change the environment back to what it was, or we change our genetics to fit the new environment.
</p>


<p>
Modern civilization will collapse if we don&rsquo;t implement EPC: <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/11/dysgenics-overpopulation-and.html?view=classic">Overpopulation and Conventional Ignorance</a>
</p>

Even worse, if modern civilization collapses, it will probably never recover since fossil fuels that powered it will already be all used up, and the necessary energy won&rsquo;t exist anymore to restart industrial civilization. The scientific knowledge, technological complexity, social complexity, and economic complexity will all fall apart if that happens: <a href="https://notetoworld.org/index.php?loc=note&amp;key=60a6647e-766e-42de-a3e4-6bbbf864a4d5">Why Modern Civilization Will Never Recover If It Falls</a>
</p>

<p>
A strong argument in favor of eugenics is how evolution is <i>not</i> guided by a human brain. Again, it must be stated and emphasized that the humans that did get to pass their genes onto the next generation only had to be <i>smart enough</i> to build shelter, hunt and gather food/water, and raise healthy children for the next generation. It could be argued that evolution simply hasn&rsquo;t gone far enough in selecting more intelligent humans.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, if someone is going to be of the position that eugenics is always bad under all circumstances, then they ought to be against the widely practiced and socially acceptable forms of eugenics mentioned in this section: <a href="#eugenics-in-modern-society">Eugenics in Modern Society</a>

<h3 id="welfare-states-unsustainable"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> Why are Welfare States Unsustainable?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-welfare-states-unsustainable">
<p>
Because welfare states subsidize the reproduction of unproductive and irresponsible people who tend to have more children than they can afford to take of, at the expense of the productive through taxation. Having welfare can be justified for the sake of being humane, but the positive feedback loops it introduces (more dependents -&gt; more welfare -&gt; yet more dependents etc) makes for an unsustainable system in the absence of a compensating negative feedback loop(s).
</p>

<p>
Given enough generations or so, the inevitable outcome of a welfare state is a population where the majority of the people living in it are irresponsible and unable to take of themselves. If we reach this point, then society and modern civilization will collapse due to immense irresponsibility, lack of self-sufficiency, increased violence, and financial bankruptcy.

<p>
You can&rsquo;t be truly anti-welfare unless you&rsquo;re pro-EPC. If you are anti-welfare <i>and</i> anti-EPC, then the only other option is to let impoverished children starve to death, which everyone would be quick to label as inhumane.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sustainable: A Sustainable future, fewest moral dilemmas.</li>
<li>Unnecessary: Being Pro-EPC already eliminates the need for virtually all welfare, except during extremely dire situations (similar to the Great Depression or WWII), so there&rsquo;s no dilemmas or contradictions here.</li>
<li>Inhumane: Impoverished children must starve (to death), since there&rsquo;s no welfare, and there&rsquo;s no system in place to prevent the need for a welfare state in the first place.</li>
<li>Unsustainable: The status quo, a system that subsidizes irresponsibility and taxes responsibility because anti-welfare is &ldquo;cruel&rdquo; and pro-EPC is &ldquo;evil&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The best solution to this dilemma is to enforce <a href="#reproduction-license-reqs">these requirements for people to have children</a>, so that we can eliminate the unsustainablility of the welfare state, while achieving the most humane conditions possible.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-get-rid-of-welare-state">
<p>
It is technically sustainable to just let people die if they can&rsquo;t take care of themselves or their children, and this has been the condition that most humans have faced throughout humanity&rsquo;s history. The problem however is that this conflicts with most people&rsquo;s moral intuitions to let people die during Modernity. For that reason, this option will probably never be collectively chosen by the majority of people in society, unless Modernity collapses and Humanity reverts to pre-Industrial conditions.
</p>

<p>
Libertarians might argue that getting rid of the welfare state will incentivize parents to be more responsible for their children, and while that might be true to an extent, it is inevitable that some parents are not going to take care of their kids, regardless of whether there is a welfare state or not.
</p>

<p>
Charity is not a long-term replacement for the welfare state either because life is selected to be intrinsically selfish, so charitable memes and genes will eventually die out since Humanism is not a self-sustaining ideology.
</p>

<p>
If we get rid of the welfare state, the only long-term solution will be to enforce EPC so that irresponsible genes are selected against, while productive and responsible genes are selected for, lest people will die from being unable to support themselves and their children. If EPC were enforced today and the welfare state was eliminated overnight, there would probably be enough charity to support most former welfare-dependent people for a while for however long they live, before natural selection wipes out charitable behaviors.

Dysgenics is increasing faster than ever, due to: 1. unprecendented evolutionary mismatch created by the Industrial-Technological Revolution (humans are not well-adapted to high-tech environments), 2. the removal of selectionary pressures on the human genome (medical technologies enable all infants to live to adulthood regardless of self-sufficiency, disabilities and birth defects, etc); and 3. the proliferation of welfare state policies:

</ul>


<p>
To quote from <a href="https://brittonicmemetics.wordpress.com/2022/08/22/eugenics/">Brittonic Memetics&rsquo; essay &ldquo;Laissez-Faire Eugenics&rdquo;</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Modern medicine and abundance bear dysgenic effects because on average, everyone of us is born with 60 or so new, random mutations. Most are situated in non-coding DNA and are neutral. Of the ones that are not, the vast majority are a net negative because they introduce random change in a very ordered, highly functional structure: the human body. In a world with high newborn and child mortality, this “genetic load” is kept at a low level by repeated trimming. In the modern world, however, with very little selective pressure, genetic load simply accumulates and progressively messes up every organ, including our brains. There is still trimming occurring because we can’t save the desperate cases, but the better we are at salvaging dysfunctional bodies, the higher the threshold at which genetic load will stabilize.
</p>

<p>
Taken as groups, Europeans, East Asians and some others are well adapted to complex, modern societies and have, in that sense, a very high genetic capital. However, the dysgenic effects apply to them too. In the absence of immigration it would simply take longer for them to degrade to the point of being unable to maintain modern civilization, because they have more “capital” to burn through.
</p>

<p>
To be clear, when I say that some groups are adapted to complex, modern societies, I mean that they are able to establish one and keep it running. Of course, in an evolutionary sense, their current birthrates indicate that they are (if anything) less adapted to the conditions of modern society than overall parasitic populations. “Parasitic” here means free-riding, in the sense that welfare props up their birthrates.

<h2 id="overpop-threat"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> How is overpopulation an existential threat to humanity? Hasn&rsquo;t Malthusianism been debunked?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-overpop-threat">
<p>
If we don&rsquo;t regulate reproduction, then we are destined to face the largest most unparalleled overpopulation event in history, which will be accompanied by what will definitely be the largest <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html?view=classic">famines and wars ever seen before in human history</a>.
</p>

<p>
There will be very dire and catastrophic consequences if don&rsquo;t regulate the world population:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Food shortages and associated malnutrition, susceptibility to disease, stunted growth and stunted brain power, and starvation.</li>
<li>Per capital water shortage and poor water quality, dehydration, not enough water for crops, not enough water for freshwater ecosystems, not enough water for industrial use, etc.</li>
<li>Peak oil, which greatly impacts food supply.</li>
<li>Climate change which creates hotter, more hostile crop growing conditions and flooding, also hostile to crops.</li>
<li>Shortage of nonrenewable resources, particularly fertilizer, necessary for crop production, but also other resources needed for manufacturing, without which our materialistic civilization will grind to a halt.</li>
<li>Environmental damage caused by the quest for more fossil fuels and essential metals, destruction of animal habitat caused by urbanization.</li>
<li>Economic strain: Overpopulation can put a strain on a country&rsquo;s economy by increasing the demand for housing, transportation, and other resources. This can lead to inflation, unemployment, and a decrease in living standards.</li>
<li>Social problems: Overpopulation can lead to overcrowding, which can cause a host of social problems, such as increased crime, stress, and mental health issues.</li>
<li>Political instability: Overpopulation can also put a strain on a country&rsquo;s political and social systems, which can lead to social unrest, civil war and other forms of political instability.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Overpopulation is like a runaway train, and the longer we wait to do something about it, the harder it will be to deal with the impacts. It&rsquo;s common sense that we should figure out a way to prevent this doomsday scenario from ever happening while we still can.
</p>

<p>
Going by a. Food shortages alone, it will only get worse unless we quickly stabilize population and find some as-yet-discovered agricultural advancement. The Green Revolution has petered out. Overpopulation causes rural farming people to outgrow their lands, so the grown children move to cities. Urbanization eats up farmland, reducing crop production. Also growing seasons are becoming hotter, so many crops fail due to heat and drought. Overuse of the soils caused by overpopulation leads poor nourishment for crops and eventually desertification. Overpopulation draws on available water to the point that there is not enough to water crops. Aquifers are overdrawn to the point where they are not replenished fast enough.
</p>

<p>
<a href="./overpopulation-FAQs.html#overpop-solution">The solution that are proposing to address overpopulation while we still can</a> is a small price to pay to avoid such a <a href="./overpopulation-FAQs.html#next-overpop-crisis">humanitarian disaster.</a>

<div id="outline-container-overpopulation-and-eugenics" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="overpopulation-and-eugenics"><span class="section-number-3">5.1.</span> What is the connection between Overpopulation and Eugenics?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-overpopulation-and-eugenics">
<p>
When a population reaches the carrying capacity of its environment, competition and eugenic selection occur in order to select the organisms that are the most reproductively successful in the scarce resources environment.
</p>

<p>
By removing the selectionary pressures on humanity and limitations that have traditionally limited the carrying capacity of the human population, not only does this cause dysgenics from the removal of said selectionary pressures and the accumulation of mostly harmful mutations, but it also causes overpopulation. That said, if we achieved legally-enforced population control for humanity, then we would be placing artificial selectionary pressures that will increase the eugenic quality of the human population, that would otherwise never occur.
</p>

<p>
If someone is going to be in favor of population control, ought to be in favor of bottom-up eugenics as well (top-down eugenics would fail the same reason why command economies fail). Many people today are against eugenics because it would require restricting some people from having children, but population control does the same thing and population control will be necessary in order to prevent catastrophic disasters from happening in the future, so this is not a good argument against eugenics.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-natural-order">
<p>
That&rsquo;s a foolish objection, and an Appeal to Nature Fallacy. What is the natural order of things? Until recently, most children died young. Now, with modern civilization (based on fossil fuels) we allow most children to live to adulthood. If eugenics violates the natural order, then so does modern civilization. <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/11/dysgenics-overpopulation-and.html?view=classic">And without eugenics, modern civilization is unsustainable.</a> Eugenic population control is needed to balance the effects of modern prosperity on the human population. We could use eugenic population control to create a new &ldquo;natural order&rdquo; of sustainable prosperity. Why shouldn&rsquo;t we? Nature will not strike us down for using eugenics. In fact, the opposite is true. Nature will eventually destroy our civilization if we don&rsquo;t regulate our population eugenically.

<div id="outline-container-not-authoritarian" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="not-authoritarian"><span class="section-number-2">7.</span> Would EPC be horribly authoritarian?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-not-authoritarian">
<p>
No. It would be no more authoritarian than limiting the freedom to drive or the freedom to kill other people. Reproduction has serious consequences that can be harmful to others, and so the imposition of social constraints on reproduction is justified for the same reason that social constraints on other behaviors are justified. Reproduction licenses are the simplest, most practical, and least authoritarian solution to save the world from the war and famine that will result from overpopulation.
</p>

<p>
Also, licenses are already required to adopt children, so it is logically inconsistent to <i>not</i> also require licenses for people to have biological children.
</p>

<p>
The need for legally-mandated abortions can be reduced by requiring regular testing for compliance with the birth control laws, <i>if</i> necessary. The births of unlicensed children would be <i>extremely rare</i>, but if that did happen, there are <a href="./overpopulation-FAQs.html#fate-of-unlicensed-children">ways to deal with that reasonably</a>.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, <a href="./overpopulation-FAQs.html#life-is-zero-sum">every existing organism can only exist at the cost of another</a> since the planet has scarce resources. In a sense, merely existing as a living thing requires that one must consume scarce resources that would otherwise be taken by someone else, since that is the nature of life.

<div id="outline-container-human-rights" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="human-rights"><span class="section-number-2">8.</span> Would EPC violate human rights?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-human-rights">
<p>
For those who believe in human rights, there are plenty of good reasons why EPC would protect human rights, not violate them. To clarify, we&rsquo;re not proposing that it should be impossible for some people to have children based on predetermined factors, we&rsquo;re just proposing that there should be reasonable limits on how many children people should be allowed to have. Nowadays, most children live to adulthood, so it&rsquo;s not as necessary as it was historically to have as large families anyway. As explained here, <a href="./overpopulation-FAQs.html#why-DTT-is-wrong">voluntarily low fertility is not a feasible solution</a> for preventing overpopulation.
</p>

<p>
A child that cannot be supported by its parents is either a burden on the rest of society (which harms other members of society), or it will be harmed by neglect. Uncontrolled reproduction inflicts harm on others, so there is a clear ethical basis for socially controlling reproduction.
</p>

<p>
Licenses are already required to adopt children, so based on that fact alone, it is logically inconsistent to <i>not</i> also require licenses for people to have biological children.
</p>

<p>
EPC would select against any genetic causes of criminal behavior, thus offering further protection of human rights by significantly reducing crimes against innocent people.
</p>

<p>
Rights are whatever people decide they are, and circumstances can cause peoples&rsquo; opinions to change on what rights should be, so the only legitimate rights are legal rights. Moral rights are nonsense since <a href="./post-overton-FAQs.html">morality depends on perspective</a>.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, it is extremely important to emphasize here that what&rsquo;s at stake here is whether modern technological society thrives or permanently collapses forever. When a population reaches its carrying capacity, <a href="./overpopulation-FAQs.html#life-is-zero-sum">Life becomes a zero-sum game where every existing organism can only exist at the cost of another</a>. For anybody who values humanity having a prosperous, thriving future for humanity, what could be more important than maintaining that for humanity&rsquo;s future? If Industrial Society does collapse, there&rsquo;s a strong possibility that it will never recover and that will be it. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AoDTlbRRkw">&ldquo;Collapse is Forever&rdquo;</a>, Blithering Genius explains that if modern civilization collapses, the fossil fuels that powered modern civilization from the start of the Industrial Revolution all the way through the 18th, 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries will already be all used up, hence the necessary energy won&rsquo;t exist anymore to restart it. The scientific knowledge, technological complexity, social complexity, and economic complexity will all fall apart if that happens.

<div id="outline-container-nazis-were-dysgenicists" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="nazis-were-dysgenicists"><span class="section-number-2">9.</span> Didn&rsquo;t the Nazis try to implement Eugenics?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-nazis-were-dysgenicists">
<p>
Eugenics ≠ Nazism. If anything, the Nazis failed to implement eugenics on a scientific, rational basis. There is absolutely no scientific evidence that blonde hair, blue eyes, white skin, and other &ldquo;Aryan&rdquo; physical characteristics lead to higher intelligence. When it comes to intelligence, what matters is selecting for <i>mental</i> characteristics, not physical ones. So from a scientific perspective, the Nazis did <i>not</i> advocate for policies that enforced positive eugenics. I would also like to very strongly emphasize to the fullest extent possible that Racism is <i>not</i> Eugenics.
</p>

<p>
To the contrary, the Nazis did the exact opposite of promoting positive eugenics. Instead of encouraging the reproduction of people who were scientifically proven to be more intelligent, physically-fit, etc than the average human, the Nazis promoted a massive propaganda campaign to use as an excuse for killing people from one of the most influential and productive ethnic groups in history relative to its size: the Jews. Given the Jews&rsquo; strong record of making scientific accomplishments, contributing to human progress, and acquiring positions of power, killing millions of them is the opposite of what someone should be doing if they want to promote positive eugenic traits like intelligence, responsibility, physical fitness, etc.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s also important to recognize that the Nazis&rsquo; conception of &ldquo;eugenics&rdquo; was dirigiste, whereas our proposal for eugenics is laissez-faire. It can be argued that the Nazis did promote negative eugenics in the form of preventing physically disabled, mentally disabled, diseased, etc people from reproducing. However, none of those people would be prevented from reproducing under our approach to eugenics as long as they meet <a href="#reproduction-license-reqs">the list of requirements</a>. Not only is our approach guaranteed to work better <a href="#why-laissez-faire-is-best">for all the reasons stated here</a>, but it&rsquo;s also more liberal.
</p>

<p>
The Nazis promoted racism, propaganda, and pseudo-science, which they used as one of their cover justifications for mass murder during the Holocaust. What we are advocating for is <i>real</i> eugenics under a laissez-faire approach, i.e. policies that are backed by reasoning, scientific evidence, and non-partisanship.

<p>
In theory, an ethnostate could also be a eugenostate, but in order to be both, it would have to have the requirements of an ethnostate, namely a loyal and homogeneous ethnic population with strict immigration requirements on not only eugenics, but also on the applicants&rsquo; ethnicities. If a eugenostate had to be an ethnostate as well, then that would make it harder for it to accomplish its goal of eugenics because it would have to deny applicants who are of a different race, even if they have eugenic qualities that would benefit the state&rsquo;s population.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why-laissez-faire-is-best">
<p>
Any good laissez-faire eugenics policy you would have to make sure that it doesn&rsquo;t favor people who are attractive towards one type of occupation over another, lest the reproductive success of people who work important occupations that are not favored by the jags policy with die out, and then there would be no one left with the most apt genetics for doing those occupations.
</p>

<p>
This <a href="#reproduction-license-reqs">reasonable set of requirements</a> would create a healthy population with plenty of desirable genetic diversity, aside from traits that make people prone to be less cooperative, less intelligent, less productive, more violent, etc. We want our population to have enough genetic diversity so that an unpredictable change to the environmental circumstances will ensure that our population will be able to adapt to the changing circumstances.
</p>


<p>
These requirements would eventually cause the ability to pay the Reproduction Tax to become the primary selectionary pressure since the demand for reproduction licenses would gradually increase over time while the supply stays the same, unless the carrying capacity rises and <a href="./overpopulation-FAQs.html#LMPL">the government authorizes an increase in the number of reproduction licenses</a>, since we already have a sizable populace who is capable of meeting the other requirements. The Reproduction Tax is a logical consequence of <a href="../economics/georgism-EPC-connection.html">sound economic reasoning and population dynamics</a>. It also selects for productivity, which in turn selects for intelligence and pragmatism.

<h3 id="why-not-select-for-IQ"><span class="section-number-3">12.1.</span> Why not select for IQ instead?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-why-not-select-for-IQ">
<p>
Because selecting for IQ is not a good basis for eugenics. IQ is not a stable metric since it can vary across lifetimes or across historical periods, and is also susceptible to environmental factors like the Flynn Effect, not to mention that it&rsquo;s not a good idea to control who people can and cannot marry.
</p>

<p>
Even if IQ was a stable metric and predictor of intelligence, whatever gets prioritized by natural selection (or eugenics) comes at the cost of decreasing other potentially desirable traits. In this case, selecting only for IQ might make the population more intelligent, but it wouldn&rsquo;t select for the ability to rear children nor for physical fitness. The end result would be a really smart population that isn&rsquo;t capable of producing descendants, in which case a eugenics system that only selects for IQ would be its own worst enemy. The birth rates would plummet to being well below replacement fertility for enough generations to the point where the society would be extremely vulnerable to attacks from foreign invaders.
</p>

<p>
Regression to the Mean is another reason why EPC based on IQ is impractical. Two people with lower IQs than their ancestors could give birth to children with higher IQs than them due to Regression to the Mean.

Creating selectionary pressures in favor of more productive people will yield a more productive society.

One of the reasons for this is that the psychological need to go through the <a href="../misc/industrial-society-and-its-future-manifesto.html#power-process">Power Process</a> strongly incentivizes many people (myself included) to not steal things that we desire or cheat/slack off on the job in life.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-effects-on-society">
<p>
Since the <a href="./overpopulation-FAQs.html#overpop-solution">proposed requirements</a> would require couples to be married with one of the couples being employed in a full-time job, this means that the trend where it has been becoming increasing more common for children to be born to parents out of wedlock in recent decades would end immediately. This would instantly eliminate single-parent households, thus resulting in a society with much more desirable family structure and greater social stability.
</p>

<p>
Population control would cause us to move from the traditionally high fertility levels that human societies have historically had to relatively low fertility levels, so this would necessitate redefining the role of women in society, compared to what it has been traditionally (raising children and housekeeping). A society with population control would also be a society where women raise fewer children on average, so this would mean that women would be spending more time doing other things, like working paid jobs in the economy.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, since population control would make it harder to have children, this would make having children higher status among both men and women. In modern society, having children has become lower status since it&rsquo;s become more socially acceptable for people to not have children. Enforcing population control would reverse that trend since people, especially men, are socially driven to pursue higher status. When people see other people with lots of children, people will learn to associate having lots of children with higher social status, as things should be. This is a good thing because this <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/03/alienation-and-art.html">reduces the alienation from our natural biological instincts</a> that has been caused by modern technology and it also keeps us more in sync with our <a href="../epistemology/axiology.html#reproduction-ultimate-value">biological purpose</a>.
</p>

<p>
This would also balance out the sexual market. Since it would be illegal to have children without another parent who is legally contracted to help raise the child, there would be no more single mothers, who are highly undesirable for men to date for a number of reasons. This would increase the number of women for men to date.
</p>

<p>
Another factor that would balance out the sexual market is how women wouldn&rsquo;t be liberated from men anymore. The modern welfare state and culture of modernity have liberated women from men. [elaborate on this]

<p>
That would only happen if we were using dirigiste eugenics. What we&rsquo;re proposing is laissez-faire eugenics
</p>

<p>
Laissez-faire eugenics would definitely decrease the frequency of genes that cause people to be dumber, more violent, less productive, etc, but that&rsquo;s exactly what we want. How could there possibly be any downsides to removing them from the gene pool? And what benefits would there be to keeping those genes within the gene pool?
</p>

<p>
The goal of eugenics wouldn&rsquo;t be to increase or decrease genetic diversity, generally speaking. But it could potentially increase genetic diversity of some rare, desirable genes.

<div id="outline-container-increasing-genetic-diversity" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="increasing-genetic-diversity"><span class="section-number-3">15.1.</span> How Eugenics could increase genetic diversity, rather than reduce it</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-increasing-genetic-diversity">
<p>
Contrary to this question, eugenics could actually increase genetic diversity of some rare, desirable genes. So the strongest argument against eugenics might be that it reduces genetic diversity.
</p>

<p>
Suppose that a eugenics policy merely only aims to alter the proportions to which certain genes and alleles exist within the population, not to completely eliminate one gene in favor of another. For instance, if two hypothetical genes A and B exist in a population at percentages 80% and 20% respectively, what if the goal was to cause those genes to exist at 50% each? As another example, it is known that most humans have trichromatic vision and that tetrachromatic vision only exists in very, very few humans, perhaps only women exclusively. If a eugenics or genetic engineering policy aimed to increase the percentage of people with tetrachromatic vision in the population, then this would be another example of eugenics leading to an increase in genetic diversity, and one that seems like it should be very favorable.
</p>

<p>
Going even further, if the goal of a eugenics policy was to <i>increase</i> genetic diversity rather than to <i>decrease</i> it, this would lead to some very interesting things to ponder about. For one thing, the strongest argument against eugenics that it would decrease genetic diversity would not apply.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, a eugenics policy might aim to modify the genetic composition to be more uneven, like modifying genes A and B to exist from 50% each to percentage ratios like 70/30, 80/20, or even 90/10, but not to 100/0% where one of the genes would be completely eliminated from the population.

<p>
There are both good and bad consequences for requiring prospective parents to get DNA testings.

On one hand, it can be argued that anything that gets measured is also <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/">bound to be controlled by the government</a>.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, it can be argued that it is anti-knowledge and anti-truth to insist that we shouldn&rsquo;t collect any statistics at all. Refusing to collect statistics about X is equivalent to choosing to be deliberately ignorant about X. For instance, we would never have statistical evidence for confirming the truth about race realism if it was forbidden to collect statistics on how different races and immigrants perform regarding education, crime rates, income levels, etc. Deliberately not collecting statistics would be deliberately limiting our knowledge of reality.

<h2 id="reproduction-license-reqs"><span class="section-number-2">17.</span> The Requirements For Being Granted A Reproduction License</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-reproduction-license-reqs">
<p>
In the interest of preserving modern civilization and preventing war, disease, and famine, there must be a <a href="./overpopulation-FAQs.html#LMPL">maximum population limit</a> enforced for the country&rsquo;s total number of citizens by requiring anybody who wants to have children to acquire a Reproduction License for each child that they want to have. A reproduction license will be granted to every married couple who manages to meet all of the following requirements:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Citizen must be law-abiding and have no criminal record,</li>
<li>The Citizen must have a high school education [at least] and be at least 18 years old,</li>
<li>The Citizen must be legally married to someone. Both partners must sign a legal agreement with the government pledging responsibility for raising the child by themselves,</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One of the couples in the marital agreement must be employed in a full-time job,</li>
<li>The Citizen must have paid all their <a href="../economics/georgism-elevator-pitch.html">Land Value Tax payments</a> (if any),</li>
<li>The Citizen must pay the Reproduction Tax for having a child, which is set according to market rates with respect to the <a href="../economics/georgism-EPC-connection.html">Supply, Demand, and Price of Reproduction Licenses</a>.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup></li>

Then they don&rsquo;t deserve to have children, but there should be no controversy on this. These requirements are <i>very</i> easy for people to meet.

Anybody who&rsquo;s going to have children ought to prove that they will be able to take care of them.

<a href="./overpopulation-FAQs.html#if-no-pop-regulation">This is we will have to deal with if we don&rsquo;t regulate our population</a>. If a meteor was heading towards Earth, would you argue that we shouldn&rsquo;t destroy or redirect it, merely because it would be &ldquo;too difficult&rdquo; to try that? If it is absolutely necessary to enforce population control in the interest of preventing unprecedented apocalyptic scenarios, then any argument that population control will be too difficult or morally objectionable to enforce does not constitute a valid refutation against population control. We recognize that the proposed methods for implementing population control on this FAQs page may be very undesirable for most people, but we have proposed them nonetheless because we strongly believe that they are the most minimal set of restrictions to impose for preventing global overpopulation and its unprecedented consequences.
</p>

<p>
Instead of arguing against the proposed implementation of population control, it would be vastly more productive for people who are opposed to population control to decisively prove with sound arguments that it is unnecessary to be cautious about overpopulation. If people can successfully prove that population control will not be necessary to prevent <a href="./overpopulation-FAQs.html#if-no-pop-regulation">its disastrous consequences in the future</a>, then we will concede that there is no reason to enforce population control, and no reason to debate <i>how</i> population control should be implemented. Until the opposition provides a sound and convincing argument why population control is unnecessary, that is the primary topic to be debated.
</p>

<p>
But to answer the question: No. Population control would be easier than enforcing many current laws, including traffic regulations and the law against murder. The law against murder is difficult to enforce because it is often difficult to identify murderers. Some murders go unsolved. No one uses this as an argument that murder should be legal. It is much easier to identify people who have unlicensed children than it currently is to identify murderers. It&rsquo;s pretty hard to conceal a child. <i>They will be found eventually.</i> If bounty programs are necessary in order to find and report unlicensed children, then so be it.

<p>
If given a choice, most people will choose government over tribal warfare. Government has been historically important for reducing crime rates and selecting for genes that increase intelligence and make crime less common (<a href="https://hbdchick.wordpress.com/2012/01/25/outbreeding-self-control-and-lethal-violence/">Source 1</a>, <a href="https://hbdchick.wordpress.com/2012/11/21/violence-around-the-world/">Source 2</a>).

<p>
Georgist reasoning compliments the population control scheme that we want to implement extremely well, and not by coincidence if we expand the notion of &ldquo;natural resources&rdquo; to also include the finite supply of organisms that can exist within a finite environment. Since life is a zero-sum competition game for energy when a population reaches its carrying capacity, anybody who has children in such an environment would be doing so at the cost of preventing other people to have children as well. This is very similar to how anybody who occupies a parcel of land prevents other people from using that parcel.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-reproduction-tax-conditions">
<p>
The conditions are easy to understand, provided that you have an understanding of both Georgism <i>and</i> population dynamics.
</p>

<p>
If EPC was enacted in a country, and the number of people who apply for reproduction licenses is smaller than the number of babies that can be born within that year, then there would be no tax on reproduction. This is just like how there is no need to tax land or natural resources in order to solve the tragedy of the commons with regards to scarce resources if there is plenty of valuable land for everybody.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, since populations naturally reproduce up to the carrying capacities of their environments when the species is well-adapted to its environment, then the population would spend most of its time in an Evolutionarily Stable State (ESS), so there wouldn&rsquo;t be any need to worry about whether or not the population will have enough children up to the Legal Maximum Population Limit. But in the event that the population is significantly lower than the carrying capacity, then <a href="#reproduction-tax-conditions">there wouldn&rsquo;t be any need to tax reproduction at all</a>. Since the population of the EPC country would spend most of its time the legally maximum population limit with very fluctuation from one year to the next, the population size would be very constant for many years or decades, assuming that the government doesn&rsquo;t pass a law to change the maximum population birth rate, and no unexpected events like war occur.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-multiple-concurrent-births">
<p>
Pregnancy screenings can detect how many children are in the womb before they are ever born. Under certain circumstances, perhaps the government could offer couples some kind of &ldquo;twin insurance&rdquo; that would be factored into the cost of each reproduction license, or as an additional cost at some point through the pregnancy, which ensures that any additional children who are born get to live. If this happens, there is plenty of time for the couple to decide if they want to buy twin insurance or not. However, this would be done very carefully so that people wouldn&rsquo;t be able to exploit it as a cheaper way to have more children, such as taking drugs or other substances that make multiple pregnancies more likely.
</p>

<p>
If it is necessary, the eugenostate could pass laws ensuring that pregnant women don&rsquo;t take drugs or other substances that make multiple pregnancies more likely, unless enough money was paid to buy additional reproduction licenses.
</p>

<p>
Ultimately, the couple can only have as many children as they have reproduction licenses, unless they purchased insurance and insurance is allowed. If a pregnancy test indicates that multiple babies are born, the government can offer the married couple to buy twin insurance or another reproduction license, but if the couple cannot afford it, then only the healthiest newborn gets to live and the others must be euthanized. That may seem highly undesirable, but once again, we have to keep in mind what will happen <a href="./overpopulation-FAQs.html#if-no-pop-regulation">if we don&rsquo;t regulate our population</a>.

This depends on the parent&rsquo;s cause of death.
</p>

<p>
Anybody who kills a parent (accidentally or unintentionally) will be legally liable to pay child support for all of that parent&rsquo;s child&rsquo;s expenses until the children become <a href="../civilization/age-of-adulthood.html">legal adults or 18 years old</a>. This includes drunk drivers and people who text while driving, if they accidentally kill a parent.

<p>
Maybe? I need to think about this some more.
</p>

<p>
It would probably be best if only a person and their spouse worked to get the money to pay for their reproduction license, but if <a href="../civilization/boosting-western-fertility.html">these ideas for raising fertility rates in the West</a> were adopted, the EPC eventually selected for a population where everybody is almost equally productive and hardworking, everybody has a nearly equal desire to have as many children as everybody else, and the legal maximum population limit of the society could not be raised any higher, then theoretically, it could be possible to eventually create a situation where there is a very, very high demand for reproduction licenses while the supply stays the same. This would mean that reproduction licenses would become very expensive, and it would be nigh impossible for anybody to get married and buy reproduction license at the youngest ages (18+) probably won&rsquo;t have enough money to buy one. <a href="../economics/georgism-EPC-connection.html#conclusion">See the supply and demand curve here for better understanding.</a> If this happens, parents and grandparents who are interested in increasing their reproductive success might start buying reproduction licenses for their offspring so that they can out-compete the competition. If this proved to be problematic, it could be outlawed.

<p>
NOTE: I still have to think about whether sperm and egg donations should be allowed at all.
</p>

<p>
But if they are going to be legal, then a separate type of reproduction license would have to be obtained for people who wan to donate their sperm or eggs. It differs from the married reproduction license since it has different requirements, and there are different market rates for purchasing a donor&rsquo;s license since there are different dynamics at play.

<div id="outline-container-genetic-engineering" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="genetic-engineering"><span class="section-number-2">26.</span> What about genetic engineering instead?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-genetic-engineering">
<p>
Genetic engineering has many potential benefits, and one of them is that it tends to conflict less with people&rsquo;s moral values, since people are less likely to associate Nazism and racism with it as they typically would for eugenics.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s possible that genetic engineering could affect the evolution of humans to a limited extent, but even if it does, genetic engineering is still more expensive than natural reproduction, so it would be limited mostly to the educated middle/upper classes of society, who have lower fertility rates. Designer babies are probably never going to be the most common way of having kids, especially not among the poorer, less intelligent factions of society who have higher fertility rates. For that reason and more, genetic engineering won&rsquo;t eliminate the need for some form of laissez-faire eugenics, as explained in more depth in the following essay: <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/02/we-cannot-transcend-evolution.html?view=classic">We Cannot Transcend Evolution</a>
</p>

<p>
Designer babies would still require top-down regulation of reproduction, since it is unlikely that most parents would make good choices about their designer babies. Whatever traits parents do choose would probably have unforeseen consequences as people compete in Tragedies of the Commons to have the most beautiful children, the most athletic children, obedient children, or whatever other arbitrary qualities people would select for in designer babies. It wouldn&rsquo;t be much different from how people have selectively bred dogs for thousands of years to have all sorts of different qualities across hundreds of different dog breeds. Many of those dog breeds would die out without human support. With uncontrolled genetic engineering, most people probably select for adaptive traits that would make the offspring reproductively successful, so the end result would be eventually extinction due to below replacement fertility rates, similar to those seen in the Modern Western World. Parents, governments and society all have different desires for what specific traits they would select for in designer babies, so that&rsquo;s another problem.
</p>

<p>
Instead of trying to circumvent the moral stigmas associated with eugenics and introducing an innumerous list of unforeseen consequences, it would just be better to institute the <a href="#reproduction-license-reqs">this proposed list of requirements</a> for having children.
