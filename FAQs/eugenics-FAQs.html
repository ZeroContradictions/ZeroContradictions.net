In simpler words, Eugenics just means selecting for traits that we value in other human beings, traits such as intelligence and responsibility.</dd>
<dt>Dysgenics</dt><dd>The opposite of eugenics. The accumulation of traits that make people/organisms <i>less</i> adaptive to their environments, thus resulting in Evolutionary Mismatch. Dysgenics usually arises when selectionary pressures are removed.</dd>
<dt>Evolutionary Mismatch</dt><dd>When evolved traits that were once advantageous become maladaptive due to changes in the environment. As it relates to humans, nearly all the evolutionary mismatch in the modern world is caused by rapid technological advancements that occurred during the Industrial Revolution.

<dt>Dirigiste (Top-down) &ldquo;Eugenics&rdquo;</dt><dd>The supposed improvement of human hereditary qualities through overly selective breeding, thus causing a dramatic reduction in genetic diversity. It can be done by either positive eugenics or negative eugenics. Ironically, top-down &ldquo;eugenics&rdquo; would actually make people less adaptive to their environments, hence why the term is used with quotes.</dd>
<dt>Laissez-Faire (Bottom-up) Eugenics</dt><dd>The improvement of human hereditary qualities by requiring reproduction licenses (which have minimal requirements) in order for people to have children. Laissez-Faire Eugenics during Modernity would be the re-introduction of reasonable selectionary pressures on the human genome.</dd>
<dt>Positive Eugenics</dt><dd>Encouraging or subsidizing people with good genetic qualities to reproduce more.</dd>
<dt>Negative Eugenics</dt><dd>Preventing or discouraging people with bad genetic qualities from reproducing.</dd>

<dt>Neo-Malthusianism</dt><dd>The theory and concern that overpopulation (and overconsumption) may increase resource depletion and/or environmental degradation and lead to ecological collapse or other hazards. Neo-Malthusianism is often coupled with advocacy of human population planning to ensure sufficient resources for current and future human populations as well as for other species.</dd>
<dt>Cornucopianism</dt><dd>The pseudo-scientific theory that overpopulation, overconsumption, and environmental problems faced by society either do not exist or can be solved by technology and/or the free market.</dd>

<dt>Eugenic Population Control (EPC)</dt><dd>Population Control via mandatory Birth Control and (Laissez-Faire) Eugenics via Reproduction Licenses.</dd>
<dt>Overpopulation Crisis</dt><dd>When the carrying capacity is so high above the carrying capacity, that War, Disease, and Famine start to occur.</dd>
<dt>Carrying Capacity</dt><dd>The maximum population size of a biological species that can be sustained by that specific environment, given the food, habitat, water, and other resources available.</dd>
<dt>Population Buffer Space (PBS)</dt><dd>The estimated difference between the Carrying Capacity and the LMPL.</dd>
<dt>Legal Maximum Population Limit (LMPL)</dt><dd>The maximum population limit of the society that the population must avoid exceeding, in the interest of avoiding an Overpopulation Crisis, as set by a eugenostate. The LMPL is always lower than the Carrying Capacity, with the Population Buffer Space being the quantitative difference between them. The LMPL is meant to be a target population the society should stay below, but if the population does rise above it, the Population Buffer Space gives the eugenostate some flexibility, as it still avoids exceeding the Carrying Capacity.</dd>

<div id="outline-container-what-is-eugenics" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="what-is-eugenics"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> What is Eugenics?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what-is-eugenics">
<p>
Eugenics is the improvement of genetic qualities through selection, to make people/organisms more adaptive to their relative environments.
What is considered &ldquo;Eugenic&rdquo; is always relative to a given environment, but if the environment in question is not specified, it&rsquo;s usually assumed to be Modernity.
In simpler words, Eugenics just means selecting for traits that we value in other human beings, such as intelligence and responsibility.
No matter what we do, the social environment places selective pressures on the human genome.
Eugenics means that we consciously choose to select for traits that make people better members of society.
</p>

<p>
Making people better doesn&rsquo;t sound like such a horrible thing, but it does imply that people aren&rsquo;t born equal, and so it conflicts with the <a href="../FAQs/morality-FAQs#what-is-humanism">humanist</a> belief in the intrinsic value and equality of human beings.
The racial aspect of dysgenics makes it even more taboo.
Not only are individuals unequal, <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#environmental-factors">races are also unequal</a>.
That doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to genocide races to have eugenics, but it does mean that <a href="#race-gaps">any race-blind eugenics program would have a disparate effect on racial demographics</a>.
Instead of dealing with the moral and social issues involved, our culture just pretends that evolution doesn&rsquo;t apply to humans.
This is not rational.
It is willful ignorance.
</p>

<p>
Different people each define &ldquo;eugenics&rdquo; differently, with the broadest (and dare we say more accurate) definitions including the prohibition of incest and the selection of desirable traits since those help improve the quality of the gene pool.
A gene pool cannot maintain a good quality if it allows a significant amount of incest, so prohibiting incest should count as <i>negative eugenics</i> at the very least.
</p>

<p>
The definition of Eugenics and people&rsquo;s opinions of it are affected by the <a href="../language/sapir-whorf-theory">Sapir-Whorf Effect</a>.
Some people mistakenly believe that eugenics has to involve race, that it has to be tied to Nazism, or that <a href="#why-laissez-faire-is-best">it has to involve cherry-picking specific traits</a>, and many other misconceptions, so this FAQs page was created to address all these misunderstandings and explain how eugenics can, in fact, <a href="#why-implement-eugenics">collectively benefit society</a>.
</p>

<p>
We are mainly arguing for <a href="#PC-and-eugenics">population control</a>, above all else.
Fortunately, a favorable genetic selection will naturally follow from that, similar to how natural selection improves the fitness of organisms in nature.
Depending on how eugenics is defined, <a href="#reproduction-license-reqs">the regulations we are proposing</a> arguably don&rsquo;t count as eugenics after all.
If so, then we&rsquo;re only proposing population control and nothing else.
For this reason, many of the sections on this FAQs page will link to the <a href="../FAQs/overpopulation-FAQs">Overpopulation FAQs</a> page, where the questions are answered there.

</p>

<p>
There is already popular support for several widely practiced and commonly accepted forms of Eugenics in modern society.
Those instances just aren&rsquo;t called Eugenics when they occur.
Some examples include: aborting fetuses that have severe birth defects, outlawing incest between close relatives, <a href="https://quadrant.org.au/magazine/2015/05/eugenics-ready/">replacing defective mitochondrial DNA in children conceived via IVF</a>, and the prohibition of sperm and egg donations from people who have ADHD, ASD, or do not meet certain height requirements from some donor banks.
We support all those instances of eugenics, <a href="#why-laissez-faire-is-best">except for the last one</a>.

<h2 id="why-implement-eugenics"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Why do you want to implement Eugenics? How is dysgenics a threat to humanity?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why-implement-eugenics">
<p>
A better question would be: Why shouldn&rsquo;t we implement eugenics?
We live in a time where there is unprecedented evolutionary mismatch between the people living in society and the modern technological industrial environment. Biological evolution is slower than cultural evolution and humans evolve more slowly than pathogens.
</p>

<p>
The only ways to solve the evolutionary mismatch facing us today are: 1. get rid of modern civilization, or 2. eugenics.
We argue that the latter is far more preferable than the former.
Either we change the environment back to what it was, or we change our genetics to fit the new environment.
</p>


<p>
Modern civilization will collapse if we don&rsquo;t implement EPC.
Even worse, if modern civilization collapses, it will probably never recover since the fossil fuels that powered it will already be all used up, and humans won&rsquo;t have the necessary energy input to restart industrial civilization.
The scientific knowledge, technological complexity, social complexity, and economic complexity <a href="https://notetoworld.org/index.php?loc=note&amp;key=60a6647e-766e-42de-a3e4-6bbbf864a4d5">will all fall apart if that happens</a>.
</p>

<p>
Evolution is <i>not</i> guided by a human brain.
The humans that did get to pass their genes onto the next generation only had to be <i>smart enough</i> to build shelter, hunt and gather food/water, and raise healthy children for the next generation.
Evolution hasn&rsquo;t gone far enough in selecting more intelligent humans.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, if someone is going to insist that eugenics is always bad under all circumstances, then they ought to be against all <a href="#eugenics-in-modern-society">socially acceptable forms of eugenics</a> as well.

<div id="outline-container-welfare-states-unsustainable" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="welfare-states-unsustainable"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Why are Welfare States Unsustainable?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-welfare-states-unsustainable">
<p>
Welfare states are a <a href="../civilization/political-philosophy#free-rider-problems">free-rider problem</a>.
They tax productive self-sufficient people in order to subsidize the reproduction of unproductive and irresponsible people who tend to have more children than they can afford to take of.
The EPC system that we are proposing eliminates the need for child support and related welfare by guaranteeing that parents have to self-sufficient in order to have children.
Having welfare can be justified for the sake of being humane, but the positive feedback loops it introduces (more dependents -&gt; more welfare -&gt; yet more dependents etc) creates an unsustainable system in the absence of a compensating negative feedback loop(s).
</p>

<p>
With enough generations or so, the inevitable outcome of a welfare state is a population where the majority of the people living in it are irresponsible and unable to take care of themselves. If we reach this point, then society will collapse due to immense irresponsibility, lack of self-sufficiency, increased violence, and financial bankruptcy.

<p>
You can&rsquo;t be truly anti-welfare unless you&rsquo;re pro-EPC. If you are anti-welfare <i>and</i> anti-EPC, then the only other option is to let impoverished children starve to death, which everyone would label as inhumane.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sustainable: A Sustainable future, fewest moral dilemmas.</li>
<li>Unnecessary: Being Pro-EPC eliminates the need for virtually all welfare, except during extremely dire situations (similar to the Great Depression or WWII), so there&rsquo;s no dilemmas or contradictions here.</li>
<li>Inhumane: Impoverished children must starve (to death) since there&rsquo;s no welfare and no method for preventing their unfortunate existence in the first place.</li>
<li>Unsustainable: The status quo, a system that subsidizes irresponsibility and taxes responsibility because anti-welfare is &ldquo;cruel&rdquo; and pro-EPC is &ldquo;evil&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The best solution to this dilemma is to enforce <a href="../FAQs/eugenics-FAQs#reproduction-license-reqs">reasonable legal requirements for people who want to have children</a>, so that we can eliminate the unsustainablility of the welfare state, while achieving the most humane conditions possible.

<h3 id="get-rid-of-welare-state"><span class="section-number-3">4.1.</span> What happens if we get rid of the welfare state?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-get-rid-of-welare-state">
<p>
It is technically sustainable to just let people die if they can&rsquo;t take care of themselves or their children, and this has been the condition that most humans have faced throughout humanity&rsquo;s history. But this conflicts with most people&rsquo;s modern moral intuitions. For that reason, this option will probably never be collectively chosen by the majority of people in society, unless Modernity collapses and Humanity reverts to pre-Industrial conditions.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
But getting rid of the welfare state will incentivize parents to be more responsible.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
While that might be true to an extent, it is inevitable that some parents are <i>not</i> going to take care of their kids, regardless of whether there is a welfare state or not.
</p>

<p>
Charity is not a long-term replacement for the welfare state either because <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/04/altruism-and-selfishness.html">life is selected to be intrinsically selfish</a>, so charitable memes and genes will eventually die out since altruism is not self-sustaining.
</p>

<p>
The only long-term solution for getting rid of the welfare state will be to enforce EPC to select for productive and responsible genes and select against irresponsible genes, lest irresponsible people will die from being unable to support themselves and their children.
If EPC were enforced today and the welfare state was eliminated overnight, there would probably be enough charity to support most former welfare-dependent people for a while for however long they live, before natural selection wipes out charitable behaviors.

<div id="outline-container-welfare-and-elderly-people" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="welfare-and-elderly-people"><span class="section-number-3">4.2.</span> But most welfare goes towards elderly people, not people of reproductive age.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-welfare-and-elderly-people">
<p>
That is true (for the United States at least), but we still stand by our position that giving welfare and especially child support to people of reproductive age is both biologically and financially unsustainable because it contributes to dysgenics.
</p>

<p>
Even then, welfare for elderly people should still be opposed because it is financially unsustainable and is not conducive towards a functioning long-term society. Some examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-social-security-fund-seen-depleted-2033-year-earlier-than-previous-estimate-2023-03-31/">The US Social Security Fund is predicted to be depleted in 2033</a>.</li>
<li>When Americans pay the social security tax, it doesn&rsquo;t actually get invested towards social security. Instead, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT9LwoeYJyg">the government spends it right away to pay for other expenditures</a> since the federal government&rsquo;s deficit is so high.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_French_pension_reform_unrest">Raising the retirement age in France from 62 to 64 years old caused massive riots and protests in 2023</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-1n-05Xu6Y">The Instability of the Russian Pension Fund makes the country likely to experience political instability in the future</a>, especially given Russia&rsquo;s declining birth rate and shrinking working class.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Additionally, privatizing the US&rsquo;s Social Security program and other welfare programs for elderly people and retirees could offer much higher returns for elderly people.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-evidence-of-increasing-dysgenics">
<p>
Dysgenics is increasing faster than ever, due to: 1. evolutionary mismatch created by the Industrial Revolution (humans are not well-adapted to high-tech environments), 2. the removal of selectionary pressures on the human genome (medical technologies enable all infants to live to adulthood regardless of self-sufficiency, disabilities and birth defects, etc); and 3. <a href="#welfare-states-unsustainable">the proliferation of welfare state policies</a>:

<li>Sound Reasoning. The genome is not stable without positive selection. Even without dysgenic fertility or selection, the genome would gradually degrade by mutation. Random noise is always being added to the genome by mutation, and it must be removed to maintain the quality of the genome. What removes mutations? Selection, or in other words, differential reproduction. That selection can come from differential fertility or differential survival to adulthood.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is a serious problem that the global IQ is falling because of dysgenic fertility.
<a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-iq-question.html">IQ is not a <i>direct</i> measure of intelligence</a>.
It is just a measure of one&rsquo;s ability to take IQ tests, and it can be improved with practice.
However, it is a good proxy for a certain type of intelligence (abstract reasoning), and it is predictive of social and economic outcomes, such as income and criminality.
With other factors taken into account (such as economic system and natural resources), IQ also predicts the outcomes of societies.
Higher IQ people create societies that are better by a lot of standard metrics.
Lower IQ people create societies that are worse by a lot of standard metrics.
</p>


<p>
For now, industrialization is still raising the global standard of living (and the global rate of fossil fuel consumption), but a growing population and falling IQ will eventually reverse that trend.
Overpopulation and dysgenics both lead inexorably toward civilizational collapse.
They lead back to the ancestral condition in which our population is regulated by war, disease and famine.
To quote from <a href="https://brittonicmemetics.wordpress.com/2022/08/22/eugenics/">Brittonic Memetics&rsquo; essay &ldquo;Laissez-Faire Eugenics&rdquo;</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Modern medicine and abundance bear dysgenic effects because on average, everyone of us is born with 60 or so new, random mutations.
Most are situated in non-coding DNA and are neutral.
Of the ones that are not, the vast majority are a net negative because they introduce random change in a very ordered, highly functional structure: the human body.
In a world with high newborn and child mortality, this “genetic load” is kept at a low level by repeated trimming.
In the modern world, however, with very little selective pressure, genetic load simply accumulates and progressively messes up every organ, including our brains.
There is still trimming occurring because we can’t save the desperate cases, but the better we are at salvaging dysfunctional bodies, the higher the threshold at which genetic load will stabilize.
</p>

<p>
Taken as groups, Europeans, East Asians and some others are well adapted to complex, modern societies and have, in that sense, a very high genetic capital.
However, the dysgenic effects apply to them too.
In the absence of immigration it would simply take longer for them to degrade to the point of being unable to maintain modern civilization, because they have more “capital” to burn through.
</p>

<p>
To be clear, when I say that some groups are adapted to complex, modern societies, I mean that they are able to establish one and keep it running.
Of course, in an evolutionary sense, their current birthrates indicate that they are (if anything) less adapted to the conditions of modern society than overall parasitic populations.
&ldquo;Parasitic&rdquo; here means free-riding, in the sense that welfare props up their birthrates.

That&rsquo;s a foolish objection, and an Appeal to Nature Fallacy.
What is the natural order of things? Until recently, most children died young.
Now, with modern civilization (based on fossil fuels) we allow most children to live to adulthood.
If eugenics violates the natural order, then so does modern civilization.

<p>
We could use eugenic population control to create a new &ldquo;natural order&rdquo; of sustainable prosperity.

<h2 id="not-authoritarian"><span class="section-number-2">8.</span> Would EPC be horribly authoritarian?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-not-authoritarian">
<p>
No. It&rsquo;s no more authoritarian than limiting the freedom to drive or the freedom to kill other people.
Reproduction has serious consequences that can be harmful to others, so the imposition of social constraints on reproduction is justified for the same reason that social constraints on other behaviors are justified.
<a href="#why-laissez-faire-is-best">Reproduction licenses are the simplest, most practical, and least authoritarian solution</a> to save the world from the war and famine that will result from overpopulation.
</p>

<p>
Also, licenses are already required to adopt children because the public wants to ensure that the children will be placed in good care, so it&rsquo;s logically inconsistent to <i>not</i> also require licenses for people to have biological children.
Almost no one would argue that the rights of prospective adoptive parents are being violated if they are prohibited from adopting children due to not meeting the licensing requirements, assuming that the requirements are reasonable and fair to everybody (including gay couples).
</p>

<p>
Moreover, <a href="../civilization/case-against-libertarianism#freedom-and-population-density">higher population densities necessarily lead to more constraints on individual freedom</a>, so population control could make a society less authoritarian by causing fewer conflicts.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-nazis-were-dysgenicists">
<p>
Eugenics ≠ Nazism. To the contrary, the Nazis failed to implement eugenics on a rational, scientific basis. In some cases they even promoted <i>dysgenics</i>.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There is absolutely no scientific evidence that blonde hair, blue eyes, white skin, and other &ldquo;Aryan&rdquo; characteristics cause higher intelligence. Intelligence is affected by <i>mental</i> characteristics, not physical ones.</li>
<li>The Nazis murdered millions of people from one of the most influential and productive ethnic groups in history relative to its size: the Jews. Given the Ashkenazi Jews&rsquo; strong historical record of making scientific accomplishments and contributing to human progress, killing millions of them is the opposite of eugenics. Positive eugenics is supposed to increase the reproduction of people who are more intelligent, physically-fit, etc than the average human, but that&rsquo;s the opposite of what the Nazis did.</li>
<li>The Nazis&rsquo; conception of &ldquo;eugenics&rdquo; was dirigiste, not laissez-faire. <a href="#why-laissez-faire-is-best">Top-down eugenics causes just as many problems as it solves</a>, so it&rsquo;s actually as dysgenic as it is eugenic. Our approach to eugenics would not prevent physically disabled, mentally disabled, diseased, etc from reproducing as long as they satisfy the <a href="#reproduction-license-reqs">list of requirements</a>. Not only is our approach guaranteed to work better, but it&rsquo;s also more liberal.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The Nazis used racism, propaganda, and pseudo-science as a justification for mass murder during the Holocaust. What we are advocating for is <i>real</i> eugenics under a laissez-faire approach, i.e. policies that are backed by reasoning, scientific evidence, and non-partisanship. We would like to strongly emphasize to the fullest extent possible that racism is <i>not</i> eugenics.

<div id="outline-container-ethnostates" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="ethnostates"><span class="section-number-2">11.</span> Could Ethnostates help promote Eugenics?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-ethnostates">
<p>
See: <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#ethnostates">What are Ethnostates, and how practical are they? - Philosophy of Race FAQs</a>
</p>

<p>
In theory, an ethnostate can also be a eugenostate, as long as it enforces eugenic policies.
There are multiple definitions for ethnostates.
If the ethnostate promotes racial homogeneity, then <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/01/eugenostate-versus-ethnostate.html">it will be harder to achieve the requisites of a eugenostate</a> since it would have to accomplish two potentially conflicting goals at once.
But if the ethnostate only promotes the interests of its most dominant ethnic group, this likely wouldn&rsquo;t harm its objectives for enforcing eugenics.
In order for an ethnostate to qualify as a eugenostate, it <i>must</i> enforce eugenic reproductive control.
</p>

<p>
An advantage to ethnostates is that they are more likely to have cultural traditions that are unlikely to change over time due to <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/11/adaptive-coherence.html">adaptive coherence</a>, since it would exclude ethnicities that have different genes that could affect the memetic and cultural traditions of the society.
This could increase the society&rsquo;s stability.
By contrast, if Japan was no longer an ethnostate and it has mass foreign immigration, the culture would change, which would make the country&rsquo;s future more unpredictable and less stable.
</p>

<p>
Ethnostates could pass laws prohibiting race-mixing.
Not all race-mixing is necessarily dysgenic, and whether it is considered eugenic or dysgenic can only be compared with an existing population genepool.
For example, in a country where whites tend to have average IQ scores of ~100, if the Europeans were to race-mix with any other race besides Ashkenazi Jews or East Asians (which have average IQs estimated to be ~108 and ~106 respectively), the average IQ of the resulting children would be lower than 100.
If the country desires to maintain a high IQ, it would do them well to prevent the population from race-mixing with races that have lower IQs, <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#averages-and-exceptions">except in the case of statistical outliers</a>.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s reasonable to oppose race-mixing when it lowers IQ (and other associated, well-correlated factors like delayed gratification, personal responsibility, lower crime rates, etc) and <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#race-mixing-and-biology">biological fitness</a>.
But if the races being mixed both have high IQ and won&rsquo;t result in much decreased biological fitness, then it&rsquo;s not worth prohibiting it.
In a multiracial society, there isn&rsquo;t much benefit to preserving distinctive races as long as the population has eugenic qualities, and since <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#race-mixing">race mixing is inevitable</a> to some extent.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, ethnostates would improve eugenics and societal stability, provided that they prioritize eugenic reproductive control and they aren&rsquo;t obsessed with maintaining racial homogeneity to the detriment of their populations&rsquo; eugenic quality.

<div id="outline-container-race-gaps" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="race-gaps"><span class="section-number-2">12.</span> Would some races be more reproductively successful than others under a Eugenostate?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-race-gaps">
<p>
Yes, but that&rsquo;s a good thing.
If <a href="../civilization/georgism-crash-course">Georgism</a> and government-enforced EPC were implemented in order to preserve industrial technological civilization, there is a consensus among race realists that Europeans and East Asians would be better at reproducing in the new environment <i>on average</i>, due to their higher intelligence and greater economic productivity.
But that wouldn&rsquo;t mean that Asians and Europeans would always be better than all the other races in <i>all</i> situations.
Moreover, if the <a href="../FAQs/eugenics-FAQs">eugenostate that we support</a> did exist, it could not forbid anybody who meets all of the <a href="../FAQs/eugenics-FAQs#reproduction-license-reqs">listed requirements</a> from having children. No exceptions.
</p>

<p>
Acknowledging this is actually a good argument <i>for</i> eugenics.
If some races aren&rsquo;t as intelligent or successful as other races, then eugenics could put the less intelligent races on (more) equal footing as everyone else.
The most intelligent races became intelligent in the first place due to natural selection, and the same would have to happen to less intelligent races in order for their intelligence to increase.
Eugenics is the best (and only) way to truly eliminate the achievement gaps and discrimination between races within merit-based social systems, once and for all.

<h2 id="why-laissez-faire-is-best"><span class="section-number-2">13.</span> Why not have a Dirigiste Eugenics system instead of a Laissez-Faire Eugenics system?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why-laissez-faire-is-best">
<p>
It&rsquo;s not feasible nor reasonable to have a body of bureaucrats to micromanage a huge population.
They won&rsquo;t have the information or the incentives to make effective decisions that would benefit the entire system as a whole.
Top-down eugenics<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> would fail for the same reason why Communism always fails.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If a eugenics policy is biased towards people who are suited towards one type of occupation over another, then the genes of people who work important occupations die out, and there will be no one left with optimal genetics for doing those occupations. This would devastate society.</li>
<li>Dirigiste policies would restrict who people can and cannot marry. It&rsquo;s likely to be abused, and it would increase conflict in the society.</li>
<li>Not everybody can agree on what traits count as &ldquo;good&rdquo; or not.</li>
<li>Not everybody can agree on what counts as mental or physical illness or not. No matter how it&rsquo;s decided, it would still cause potentially desirable genes to be removed from the gene pool.</li>
<li>Dirigiste eugenics isn&rsquo;t as flexible for preventing overpopulation or population collapse. By contrast, laissez-faire eugenics uses population control in order to increase the eugenic quality of the genome, so <a href="../FAQs/overpopulation-FAQs#LMPL">it&rsquo;s more adjustable</a> for preventing both overpopulation and population collapse.</li>
</ol>
<p>
By contrast, <a href="#reproduction-license-reqs">this reasonable set of requirements</a> would create a healthy population with plenty of desirable genetic diversity, aside from traits that make people prone to be less cooperative, less intelligent, less productive, more violent, etc. We want our population to have enough genetic diversity so that an unpredictable change to the environmental circumstances will ensure that our population will be able to adapt to the changing circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Over time, the laissez-faire requirements would cause the ability to pay the <a href="../civilization/georgism-and-population-control">reproduction tax</a> to become the primary selectionary pressure since the demand for reproduction licenses would gradually increase over time while the supply stays the same, since we already have a sizable populace who is capable of meeting the other requirements.
</p>

<p>
Most (maybe all) prohibitions on people breeding due to genetic reasons would be largely unnecessary, and even detrimental to the laissez-faire system we want to achieve.
As the <a href="../civilization/georgism-and-population-control">reproduction tax</a> gets higher and higher, the competition to have healthy biologically fit children will increase in the population, thus causing most (if not all) unfavorable genes to be eliminated over time.
The reproduction tax would essentially be a modern-day replacement to the pre-industrial competition in nature that selected for human fitness.

<h3 id="genetic-diversity"><span class="section-number-3">13.4.</span> Would eugenics decrease genetic diversity?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-genetic-diversity">
<p>
No, because <a href="#why-laissez-faire-is-best">we&rsquo;re proposing laissez-faire eugenics</a>, not top-down eugenics.
Laissez-faire eugenics would decrease the frequency of genes that cause people to be dumber, more violent, less productive, etc, but that&rsquo;s exactly what we want.
There&rsquo;s no downsides to removing those genes from the gene pool.
</p>

<p>
The goal of eugenics isn&rsquo;t to increase or decrease genetic diversity, generally speaking.
But it could potentially increase genetic diversity of some rare, desirable genes.
For instance, a eugenics policy could alter the proportions to which certain genes and alleles exist within the population, not to completely eliminate one gene in favor of another.
If two hypothetical genes A and B exist in a population at percentages 80% and 20% respectively, eugenics could be to cause those genes to exist at 50% each, since <a href="#why-laissez-faire-is-best">we&rsquo;re proposing a policy that isn&rsquo;t biased towards against any useful traits</a>.
</p>

<p>
As a more specific example, most humans have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichromacy">trichromatic vision</a>, whereas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachromacy">tetrachromatic vision</a> exists in very few humans, perhaps only women exclusively.
If a eugenics policy directly or indirectly increased the percentage of people with tetrachromatic vision in the population (without necessarily depleting the population of genes for trichromatic vision), then this would be another example of eugenics leading to an increase in genetic diversity, perhaps even a favorable one.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, a eugenics policy might aim to modify the genetic composition to be more uneven, like modifying genes A and B to exist from 50% each to be percentage ratios like 70/30, 80/20, or even 90/10, but not to 100/0% where one of the genes would be completely eliminated from the population.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-reproduction-license-reqs">
<p>
In the interest of preserving modern civilization and preventing war, disease, and famine, the country must enforce a <a href="../FAQs/overpopulation-FAQs#LMPL">maximum population limit</a>. This shall be done by requiring anybody who wants to have children to acquire a reproduction license for each child that they want to have. A reproduction license will be granted to every couple of parents who manages to meet all of the following requirements:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The parent must be law-abiding and have no criminal record.</li>
<li>The parent must have a high school education [at least] and be a <a href="../civilization/age-of-adulthood">legal adult</a>.</li>
<li>The parents must sign a contractual legal agreement with the government pledging responsibility for raising the child by themselves, and both parents must meet all of these requirements.</li>
<li>One of the parents in the child-bearing agreement must be employed in a full-time job.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_incest#Degrees_of_relationship">degree of consanguinity</a> between the parents that is too low will be forbidden (incest is prohibited).</li>
<li>The parent must have paid all their <a href="../civilization/political-philosophy#government-revenue">taxes</a> (if any).</li>
<li>The parent must pay the reproduction tax for having a child, which is set according to market rates with respect to the <a href="../civilization/georgism-and-population-control">supply, demand, and price of reproduction licenses</a>.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>
The social control of reproduction is not a new idea.
It is a very old and almost universal practice.
In the past, reproduction was controlled by the institution of marriage.
Almost every society had some form of marriage that regulated human sexual behavior.
Sex outside marriage was not allowed.
We abandoned the traditional control of reproduction without understanding its function or the consequences of abandoning it.
We are now seeing the consequences (and paying the costs) of abandoning marriage.
It is time to replace marriage with a modern form of reproduction control.

On the other hand, it&rsquo;s anti-knowledge and anti-truth to not collect any statistics at all.
Refusing to collect statistics about X is equivalent to choosing to be deliberately ignorant about X.
We would never have the statistical evidence for deciding <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs">the truth about race realism</a> (one way or the other) if it was forbidden to collect statistics on how different races and immigrants perform regarding education, crime rates, income levels, etc.
Deliberately not collecting statistics deliberately limits our knowledge of reality.

<b>Side Note For Generations In The Distant Future</b>
</p>

<p>
Modern medicine and technology enable genetic diseases to accumulate and persist in the population without being selected out (e.g. cystic fibrosis).
After many generations of breeding (hundreds of years at least), these genetic diseases could eventually become a problem since the requirements don&rsquo;t apply any selectionary pressures for removing those genetic diseases.
If the dysgenics grows so much to the point where it becomes a huge cost to society, the requirements could be amended to take this into account.
But if it&rsquo;s cheap to fix the disease, then it&rsquo;s not really a problem.
It&rsquo;s all about whether amending the requirement would make a net positive contribution to society or not.
If such an amendment ever had to be made, everybody who&rsquo;s alive today would probably be dead by then, since once again, it would take at least hundred of years before something like this could ever become a problem, so this is not a restriction that would concern anybody who lives during the first several generations of the eugenostate&rsquo;s existence.
A few generations after the first implementation, the pricing of reproduction licenses could eventually take predicted health, lifespan, and longevity into account as well.
A human being is an expensive machine to create, and the longer it lasts, the more those costs are amortized over a productive lifespan.

Additionally, the eugenics system doesn&rsquo;t need to work in every single case, just on average (although we would do everything possible to increase its efficiency).
It doesn&rsquo;t matter that some hypothetical person finds a way to abuse a given system, as long as it isn&rsquo;t a systematic problem.
For instance, you can have a few or even most murderers who get away with it without making &ldquo;being a murderer&rdquo; into a viable strategy, as long as it is less adaptive than the alternative it will not be selected for.

<p>
Requiring a level of income for applying for reproduction licenses is a secondary way to limit the number of people who have children, gradually increasing the eugenic quality of the next generations of humans (assuming that people with higher-incomes are more likely to have good genes).
However, we don&rsquo;t propose this because it would face more complications, compared to <a href="../civilization/georgism-and-population-control#conclusion">what we&rsquo;ve proposed</a>:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Since it&rsquo;s possible for people to have more than one child, it would be necessary for the government to set different income brackets regarding how many reproduction licenses each parent could have. I suspect that this would be more prone to corruption, analogous to price-fixing.</li>
<li>It would require calculating cut-offs based on who&rsquo;s applied for reproduction licenses, the current available supply of licenses, the incomes of the people who have applied, and how many reproduction licenses each parent already has. By contrast, it&rsquo;s much simpler to set a fixed price for each license according to its supply and demand.</li>
<li>Pricing reproduction licenses according to supply and demand probably makes it easier to adjust for preventing population booms and population collapses since it requires simpler calculations.</li>
<li>Setting the price of licenses according to supply and demand utilizes free-market principles, which tend to work more effectively.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-georgism-and-eugenics">
<p>
Georgism and Population Control both aim to conserve natural resources that exist in fixed supply.
As a result, the two both compliment each other extremely well, and not by coincidence if we expand the notion of &ldquo;natural resources&rdquo; to also include the finite supply of organisms that can theoretically exist within a finite environment.
Since life is a zero-sum competition game for energy when a population reaches its carrying capacity, anybody who has children in such an environment would be doing so at the cost of preventing other people to have children as well.
<a href="../civilization/georgism-and-population-control#why-georgism-implies-EPC">This is similar to how anybody who occupies a parcel of land prevents other people from using that parcel</a>.

<h3 id="reproduction-tax-conditions"><span class="section-number-3">17.3.</span> Under what conditions would the Reproduction Tax not be applied?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-reproduction-tax-conditions">
<p>
If EPC is enforced in a country, and the supply of reproduction licenses (the number of babies that can be born that year) is higher than the number of applicants for reproduction licenses, then there would be no tax on reproduction.
In this case, the society and government want to raise the birth rates of the country, so it makes sense to <i>not</i> tax reproduction licenses.
This is akin to how there&rsquo;s no need to tax land or natural resources if there&rsquo;s enough resources for everybody.
There&rsquo;s no tragedy of the commons if there&rsquo;s plenty of resources and reproduction licenses for everyone.
</p>

<p>
If the developed world transitioned to <a href="../civilization/georgism-crash-course">Georgism</a> this proposed EPC scheme, Georgism would increase the carrying capacity and the supply of reproduction licenses of the West.
The West currently has below replacement fertility and a declining population, and since the supply of reproduction licenses would be higher than the demand, there would be no taxes on reproduction.
Reproduction probably wouldn&rsquo;t be taxed for at least a few decades, until there are more people applying for reproduction licenses than the legal supply of reproduction licenses, whatever year that starts to happen.
</p>

<p>
If there is no reproduction tax, then there is only negative eugenics.
Positive eugenics doesn&rsquo;t occur until the reproduction tax is applied, and it starts to increase.

<h2 id="genetic-engineering"><span class="section-number-2">20.</span> What about genetic engineering instead?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-genetic-engineering">
<p>
Genetic engineering has many potential benefits, and one of them is that it tends to conflict less with people&rsquo;s moral values, since people are less likely to associate Nazism and racism with genetic engineering as they typically would for eugenics.
</p>

<p>
Genetic engineering could affect human evolution to a limited extent, but even if it does, genetic engineering is still more expensive than natural reproduction, so it would be limited mostly to the educated middle/upper classes of society, who have lower fertility rates.
Designer babies will probably never become the most common way of having kids, especially not among the poorer, less intelligent factions of society who have higher fertility rates.
Genetic engineering won&rsquo;t eliminate the need for some form of laissez-faire eugenics, because <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/02/we-cannot-transcend-evolution.html">we cannot transcend evolution</a>.
</p>

<p>
Designer babies still require top-down regulation of reproduction, since most parents are unlikely to make good choices about their designer babies.
Whatever traits parents do choose would probably have unforeseen consequences as people compete in Tragedies of the Commons to have the most beautiful children, the most athletic children, obedient children, or whatever other arbitrary qualities people would select for in designer babies.
It would be similar to how people have selectively bred dogs for thousands of years to have all sorts of different traits across hundreds of different dog breeds.
Many of those dog breeds would die out without human support since the selected traits are actually dysgenic to their natural survival in the wild.
Similarly, the offspring of uncontrolled genetic engineering would probably have many maladaptive traits that would cause their eventual extinction due to below replacement fertility rates.
</p>

<p>
Parents, governments, and society all have different desires for what specific traits they would select designer babies to have, so that&rsquo;s another problem.
<a href="#why-laissez-faire-is-best">Dirigiste eugenics doesn&rsquo;t work</a>.
</p>

<p>
Instead of trying to circumvent the moral stigmas associated with eugenics and introducing an innumerous list of unforeseen consequences, it would just be better to institute the <a href="#reproduction-license-reqs">this proposed list of requirements</a> for having children.
