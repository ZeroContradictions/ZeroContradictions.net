<h2 id="false-sayings"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> False / Ignorant Things That People Say Language / Linguistics</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-false-sayings">
<p>
Most people are rather ignorant about linguistics and how language works.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Just about everything favoring prescriptive language over descriptive language</li>
<li>English is the easiest language to learn -i</li>
<li>English is the hardest language to learn -i</li>
<li>Everybody should just learn English -i</li>
<li>Native English speakers that don&rsquo;t understand why English words are hard to spell, despite having learned this for years in school -</li>
<li>Never, ever say &ldquo;should&rsquo;ve&rdquo;. -It is perfectly valid to say &ldquo;should&rsquo;ve&rdquo;. This is a contraction, not an agrammatical pairing of two words. More specifically, the low front lax unrounded vowel in &rsquo;have&rsquo; is reduced to a schwa. And the respective IPA transcriptions for &rsquo;should have&rsquo; and &rsquo;should&rsquo;ve&rsquo; are [ʃʊd hæv] and [ʃʊdəv].</li>
<li>It is &ldquo;I should&rsquo;ve&rdquo; not &ldquo;I should of&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Some reasons why English is particularly hard to learn is because the C makes two sounds, and there are two indefinite articles -These people are completely unaware that many, many other languages have these same features. A letter having two different sounds only accounts for a tiny fraction of what makes English spelling so difficult, and it is extremely common for languages to have different allomorphs of the same morpheme, so having two indefinite determiners based on whether the first phoneme of the following word is a vowel or a consonant is hardly a difficulty at all compared to the actual difficulties that foreign speakers are far more likely to have when learning English.</li>
<li>Esperanto is a dead language -No it isn&rsquo;t. Today it probably has more speakers than it ever has had in its history, and it even has native speakers, so this statement is false.</li>
<li>People that say &ldquo;that is not a word&rdquo; -To the contrary, there is no right or wrong usage, there is only observed usage, grammatically correct usage, and grammatically incorrect usage. So if people use something as a word, then it becomes a word, especially if it gains wide acceptance.</li>
<li>People use the word &ldquo;accent&rdquo; when they actually mean &ldquo;dialect&rdquo; -People might say this because they are unfamiliar with the word &ldquo;dialect&rdquo; and use &ldquo;accent&rdquo; more frequently, or because it is the pronunciation that stands out the most in a different dialect. When it is only pronunciation that differs, &ldquo;accent&rdquo; is apt for describing this, but when other things different such as different grammar, different vocabulary, different morphemes, different pronouns (e.g. yall, yinz, thou/thee, etc.), etc. then it is more far descriptive to say &ldquo;dialect&rdquo;.</li>
<li>People frequently confuse languages and writing systems. I&rsquo;ve seen people who have called Cyrillic, Katakana, Hiragana, Devanagari, Hangul, etc. languages when they are actually writing systems for representing languages, not languages in of themselves.</li>
<li>When people use the word &ldquo;alphabet&rdquo; to describe abugidas, abjads, and syllabaries. Perhaps &ldquo;alphabet&rdquo; is the colloquial term for any writing system that is not a pictogrphic writing system, but the way people often use the term displays an ignorance about writing systems.</li>
<li>It would be really stupid to create a new international constructed language for everybody to learn for global communication instead of using one of the most widely spoken languages in the world -</li>
<li>A professor once gave a bad explanation of why &ldquo;we&rdquo; is commonly said in proofs instead of &ldquo;I&rdquo; -This has to do with social registers, not really the explanation that the professor gave since the use of &ldquo;we&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;I&rdquo; for just one person can also be seen in social situations other than mathematical proofs.</li>
<li>A professor once claimed that logic is unambiguous whereas natural language is ambiguous -This isn&rsquo;t quite true. One of the reasons why logic symbols are unambiguous because there is only one way to say them, whereas there can be many different ways to say a logic statement in a natural language. Another reason is that &#x2026;</li>
<li>English is based on Latin / Most European languages are based on Latin -</li>
<li>Only Italian would be deserving of the title &ldquo;Modern Latin&rdquo; since this where the Romans were originally from -This is incorrect because every romance language would be deserving of the title &ldquo;Modern Latin&rdquo; since they have all descended from Latin.</li>
<li>Greek survived to the modern age, but Latin did not -This is based on &#x2026;
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In actuality, both languages survived into the modern era, but they&rsquo;re obviously not spoken the same as they were 2000 years ago. Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, and others are the modern descendants of Latin, while Modern Greek is the descendant of Ancient Greek. But there are still many people who mistakenly think that &ldquo;Latin died&rdquo; since it&rsquo;s there is no language called &ldquo;Modern Latin&rdquo; today.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>English is the hardest language to learn, Spanish is the hardest language to learn, Chinese / Japanese / Latin / Polish / Language X is the hardest language to learn - All claims about one language being &ldquo;the hardest to learn&rdquo; or &ldquo;impossible to learn&rdquo; are bogus. Any language can be learned with enough dedication and passion, and one&rsquo;s motivation determines how easy the language is to learn. A language will seem impossible if one believes it to be impossible.</li>
<li>Body language accounts for 90% of communication -This is absolutely not true for all types of communication and it is more limited in scope than most people realize. It only applies when people are communicating their likes and dislikes. It is intellectually dishonest that many people lazily spread this false claim without also saying the context that it applies to and it overemphasizes body language, even though body language is very important. A better way to emphasize body language is to not spread false claims like this around since lies/dishonest statements do not move academia forward. It is also likely that different people and different cultures would use body language more than others since everybody is different and likely has different ways of communicating, so it is also dishonest to suggest that this is a universal statement.</li>
<li>A language goes extinct every 2 weeks -These numbers are off, but are widely repeated since there was a really prominent claim that gained popularity. At the correct current rate, a language goes extinct every 3 months. A more accurate saying might be that a dialect goes extinct every 2 weeks, but that&rsquo;s still kind of pushing it.</li>
<li>The Catalogue of Endangered Languages finds that on average 3.5 languages become extinct per year, which is better than the often cited figure of &ldquo;a language goes extinct every two weeks&rdquo;.</li>

<h3 id="nitpicking"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> Things That I Will Nitpick At</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-nitpicking">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Someone said that Ukrainians have an easier time understanding Russian than Russians have understanding Ukrainian -This is true, but they didn&rsquo;t understand why this is the case. It is because the lexical similarity of Ukrainian is actually closer to Polish due to extended contact with Polish speakers despite Ukrainian being an Eastern Slavic language and Polish being a Western Slavic language, and also due to the fact that Ukrainians have greater exposure to Russian than Russians have to Ukrainian. Since Ukrainian has more Western Slavic words in it due to the Polish influence, it makes it harder for the Russians (Eastern Slavic language speakers) to understand Ukrainian.</li>
<li>People that pronounce foreign words incorrectly or don&rsquo;t know how to pronounce them -Maybe it is a bit picky to expect people to know how to pronounce foreign words that are not in languages that they are familiar with, but the patterns for knowing how to read the letters are really simple to understand in my opinion, and far more consistent than English. As for my myself, I can accurately pronounce Spanish, German, Greek, and the Cyrillic alphabet, though there might tiny details that I get wrong here and there.</li>
<li>During my college biology courses, I was able to pronounce a lot of the biological terminology for some human anatomy correctly since I could look up the IPA transcriptions and read them, whereas the lab assistants were pronouncing the terms incorrectly even though they knew more about biology than I did. They could spell the words out and recognize them when they see them, but they couldn&rsquo;t pronounce the terminology correctly. Having a brief understanding of English etymology and knowing some IPA can go a long way.</li>
