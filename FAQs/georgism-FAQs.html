<li><a href="https://gameofrent.com/content/can-lvt-be-passed-on-to-tenants">Although this page</a> claims to prove that LVT cannot get passed onto the tenants, it&rsquo;s actually not very helpful because it doesn&rsquo;t cover the effects of capital markets at all, and the empirical study discussed in the article was on tax rates too low to cause an exodus of capital from real estate. As far as I know, nobody has taken this into account when arguing that LVT cannot be passed onto the tenants.</li>

<h2 id="switching-to-georgism"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Switching to Georgism</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-switching-to-georgism">
<p>
Any conversion over to a Georgist taxation system would have to be a very gradual process, taking at least 30 years in order to give everybody enough time to re-adjust their personal finances, especially for the people who are relying on land speculation as part of their retirement portfolio. But that&rsquo;s really the only drawback to Georgism. Once you&rsquo;re through that, it&rsquo;s smooth cruising from there on out.
</p>

<p>
The way how <a href="../misc/emacs-and-keyboard-setup#colemak">I was willing to switch from Qwerty to Colemak</a>, in spite of the 1-month transition period, is analogous to how I support Georgism, which would also require a transition period. Both provide better long-term results because they are both applications of the <a href="../civilization/georgism-crash-course#space-utility-optimization-principle">Space Utility Optimization Principle</a>.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, in order for Land Value Tax to be truly effective, it must be widespread, otherwise those not having to pay a land value tax will have an even bigger advantage. This is just like how states without income tax have an advantage in labor costs over states that do have income taxes, or how states without sales taxes have an advantage in sales over states that do have sales taxes. Likewise, if a Georgist government imposes taxes on negative externalities, like pollution, there would need to be a tariff on goods from countries which didn&rsquo;t impose such a tax. Otherwise you would just be subsidizing pollution elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
It is already common practice in the real estate industry to separately evaluate of land values from property values.
The easiest way to transition to Georgism would be to gradually transition the Property Taxes so that they tax the unimproved value of the land instead of the improved value of the land, in increasingly greater proportions over time.
Property Taxes are basically a combination of a good tax (land) with a bad tax (property), so you slowly reduce the bad tax proportion to nothing while increasing the good tax proportion (LVT) to higher amounts.
And then from there, you slowly reduce sales taxes, income taxes, and so forth to 0%, while slowly increasing the LVT to 100%.
We already have all the machinery for implementing Georgism, it&rsquo;s just a matter of gaining enough political support for starting the decades-long transitioning phase by educating more people about economics.

<div id="outline-container-NRT-vs-other-taxes" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="NRT-vs-other-taxes"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Why are natural resources taxes better than other taxes?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-NRT-vs-other-taxes">
<p>
Most existing forms of taxation punish productivity.
Most existing forms of taxation are complex, ad hoc and create opportunities for corruption and tax evasion.
</p>

<p>
Although natural resource taxation has some complexity, it is much simpler than existing forms of taxation. There are a relatively small number of physical inputs to production, and they are relatively easy to audit and control. Natural resource taxation would be much simpler and fairer than applying taxes to every economic transaction, which is how the current system works.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-taxes-on-natural-resources" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="taxes-on-natural-resources"><span class="section-number-3">4.1.</span> Why would Georgism tax natural resources, and not just land?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-taxes-on-natural-resources">
<p>
By taxing the economic inputs of the economy instead of the economic outputs, there would be incentives to use the inputs (Natural Resources) more efficiently, and we should absolutely want this since there is a fixed, finite amount of valuable land and natural resources on Earth. Likewise, people wouldn&rsquo;t get penalized for generating greater economic outputs.
</p>

<p>
Although location value taxation would be the main most dominant form of taxation, the taxation of the following would depend on how large the demand for those resources is, relative to the supply:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">

<h3 id="addressing-progressive-income-tax"><span class="section-number-3">4.2.</span> Why are natural resource taxes better than a progressive personal income tax?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-addressing-progressive-income-tax">
<p>
Income tax is based on income earned by labor or investment.
If you work hard and well, or invest wisely, you will pay more income tax.
This punishes productivity, and it makes labor more expensive.
Income Tax is the sort of thing you would come up with if you were specifically trying to make the economy less efficient.
</p>

<p>
Income tax also requires individuals and companies to be accountants and keep track of financial minutia — or lie about them.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-addressing-flat-income-tax">
<p>
A simple flat tax would be relatively easy to assess compared to progressive income tax, but in most countries the income tax is very complex, with many loopholes and subsidies.

<p>
A flat income tax may have less harmful effects than a <i>progressive</i> income tax, but it would still punish productivity, and it would make labor more expensive nonetheless.

<div id="outline-container-addressing-VAT" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="addressing-VAT"><span class="section-number-3">4.4.</span> Why is natural resource taxes better than value added tax / sales tax?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-addressing-VAT">
<p>
VAT would reduce economic activity by decreasing sales in the economy.
Consumption taxes also punish productivity, although not directly.
All income is eventually used for consumption of some kind.
So, a tax on consumption is a tax on income, and thus a tax on production.
</p>

<p>
Value-added tax is very complicated, because it requires a full accounting of revenue and the costs of production. Sales and value-added taxes are often ad hoc, and vary from one jurisdiction to another.
</p>

<p>
Sales tax requires businesses to record every sale, so it incentivizes them to <i>not</i> record every sale.
By comparison, it is way easier to hide purchases and transactions than it is to hide land, especially since those purchases and transactions would be private knowledge, but not public knowledge (unless you make an authoritarian law mandating that everybody&rsquo;s transactions be made public, but even then, people would still find a way around that).
This is yet another reason why VAT is more prone to tax evasion, and would require significantly more paperwork than LVT.

<h3 id="why-LVT-better-than-property-taxes"><span class="section-number-3">4.5.</span> Why should we implement land value taxes when we already have property taxes?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-why-LVT-better-than-property-taxes">
<p>
Property Taxes make housing less affordable, whereas Land Value Taxes make more affordable.
Property Taxes reduce the supply of housing (by making it more expensive to build housing), and since the tenants thus have fewer options/alternatives to choose from, this enables the landlords to pass the Property Taxes onto the tenants.
This wouldn&rsquo;t happen at all with LVT though, because LVT would incentivize landlords to build <b>more</b> housing per square foot and they wouldn&rsquo;t get penalized for creating new floors on their land.
Since LVT would increase the supply of housing, the tenants would have many options to choose from in this buyers&rsquo; market, so LVT would <b>not</b> get passed onto the tenants.
</p>

<p>
Property taxes also tax economic improvements to the land.
Taxing economic improvements (which require human labor) make the economy less efficient because that would effectively be a tax on productivity, and thus higher undesirable.

Furthermore, <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/07/natural-resource-taxation.html">property taxes don&rsquo;t bootstrap prices within the economy</a>, nor do they conserve natural resources.

<li>There is an interesting split between geoists who believe those who create land value are obligated to receive it and geoists who believe those who occupy land value are obligated to return it.</li>

<li>This means such communities are obligated to return the land value their community resides on to everyone outside the community.</li>
<li>This would seem an insurmountable task given the size of private communities, but it is made easier if the residents of the communities themselves are ultimately paying LVT for each subsection they reside on.</li>

<p>
No. There is a <a href="https://www.prosper.org.au/2022/03/why-land-taxes-cant-be-passed-on/">consensus among economists that Land Value Tax cannot be passed onto the tenants</a>.
</p>

<p>
The basic gist is that tenants can go to another location with a lower location value.
This property owner here is being charged less in taxes because the location value is lower.
That would just mean they pass on slightly less expenses to their tenants, right?
It would, except the tenants can keep going to locations with lower and lower location value until they reach the location with zero location value.
The land here is essentially worthless.
They would prefer to live closer to the city but their expenses for living here, further out, and the expenses they would incur for living closer in the form of higher rent are identical.
The landlord must provide superior service rather than charging more for increase in location value.

It would be if 100% LVT started getting applied overnight, but only because many people&rsquo;s wealth and life savings are stored in the value of their land, especially for many middle-class homeowners.
</p>

<p>
Any conversion over to a Georgist taxation system would have to be a very gradual process, taking at least 30 years in order to give everybody enough time to re-adjust their personal finances, especially for the people who are relying on land speculation as part of their retirement portfolio. But once society is through that, the economy will be better off than it was before the transition and it will be smooth cruising from there on out.

It&rsquo;s not clear why non-taxpayers wouldn&rsquo;t have a voice.

<p>
Keep in mind that we are also in favor of <a href="file:///political-philosophy#government-revenue">head taxes</a> since we believe that everybody who benefits from government services should be required to make a contribution for receiving them.

<h3 id="org05e13be"><span class="section-number-3">5.7.</span> Wouldn&rsquo;t the land value tax (LVT) increase the price of land?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-7">
<p>
No, because it wouldn&rsquo;t change the supply or the demand for land.
</p>

<p>
Most people who ask this question mistakenly think that the LVT would be paid on top of the price of buying land. But this is inaccurate because land would <i>not</i> be bought at all under Georgism, as land could only rented by paying the LVT (the price of the land rent).
</p>

<p>
Since the land rent is the only cost to being able to possess/occupy land, since LVT would effectively be <b>the</b> price of land, and since the price of land would only be dependent on the supply and demand of land, LVT would not increase the price of land.

<div id="outline-container-wealth-inequality" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="wealth-inequality"><span class="section-number-3">5.8.</span> How would Georgism reduce wealth inequality?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-wealth-inequality">
<p>
When everybody owns land equally, this ensures that everybody has equal access to the three factors of production: <b><b>Land</b></b>, Labor, and Capital. It follows that economic productivity is increased, and wealth inequality is dramatically reduced. The massive wealth inequality that exists today is in large part caused by the skewed and unequal ownership of highly valuable land.
</p>

<p>
Since the wealthiest people are naturally the ones who own the most land and the most valuable land, Land Value Tax would therefore reduce economic inequality, because the LVT would mostly fall on the wealthiest members of society.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, Georgism would make housing more affordable. When housing is unaffordable, it tends to affect the lower classes more than the upper classes, so that&rsquo;s another way how Georgism will reduce wealth inequality.
</p>

<p>
As a thought experiment for illustrating how land is the ultimate driver of economic inequality, imagine if there were <i>no</i> scarcity of land.
Imagine so much high-quality, easily accessible land that anyone can use as much as they want without reducing the amount available for others to use.
How many of the &rsquo;problems of capitalism&rsquo; would still remain in such a world?

<p>
It <i>does</i> discourage people from owning land.
That&rsquo;s a feature, not a bug.
It ensures that people only use as much land as is efficient for them, leaving the rest for someone else to use.
That&rsquo;s what we want, as opposed to the land-hoarding and rentseeking behavior that dominates our current real estate market.
(Actually, we want to raise the tax so high that the sale price of the land becomes zero, erasing the notion of privately &rsquo;owning&rsquo; land at all.
Everyone would be a tenant on common land, paying back everyone else for the land they use and, conversely, getting paid for all the land they don&rsquo;t use.)

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-land-speculation">
<p>
Every form of rent-seeking is undesirable for an economy and that there should be laws to prevent it whenever it occurs.
We oppose Sam Bankman-Fried style speculation, but it&rsquo;s harder to make a case that that counts as rent-seeking.
SBF-style speculation is more akin to gambling instead of investing since the speculators don&rsquo;t really own any true wealth and the risks are much higher.
Gambling in small amounts won&rsquo;t hurt an economy, but it becomes a problem when it&rsquo;s done on the scale of the FTX scandal and a feedback loop is created.
</p>

<p>
If the stock market counted as rent, then that would effectively mean that there is no value in researching to distinguish between profitable investments and non-profitable investments.
To an extent, the same could be said for land speculation, but the key difference between speculating on land versus speculating on a stock is that the former deprives everyone else of a natural resource in fixed supply, whereas the latter does not.
</p>

<p>
One of the problems with making a law against SBF-style speculation is that it can difficult to define and differentiate.
It may just be better to let gamblers suffer the consequences of their actions.
I oppose capital gains tax because stocks represents real wealth, are actual investments in a company, and actually have positive benefits on the economy.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-upwards-vs-outwards">
<p>
It&rsquo;s true that you can build outwards instead up upwards if there is still uninhabited land available and the geography allows it, but it still remains the case that the supply of <b>valuable</b> locations within the jurisdiction is fixed.
</p>

<p>
Yes, there are millions of square kilometers of uninhabited land around the world, but asserting that ignores that not all of that land is equally valuable.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-farmers">
<p>
Nope. Georgism would help everybody, including farmers.
</p>

<p>
Land Value Tax != Land Area Tax. Rural land tends to be worth far less per unit area than urban land, so it&rsquo;s not as big of a deal as you might think. For instance, in the United States, urban land constitutes less than 3% of the total land area but over 70% of the total rent (and thus potential LVT revenue). So farm land could only account for less than 30% of the total, which is a very small portion of the land rent, especially in proportion to its size. If anything, farmers might receive more money via the Citizen&rsquo;s Dividend than whatever that they might pay in LVT.
</p>

<p>
For another thing, LVT would: 1. densify suburbs that sprawl into farmland, and 2. tax land speculators. Both of these factors would only make rural land cheaper for farmers.

Probably about 40% in typical developed countries. If you do the math regarding the cost of housing, the level of existing tax burdens, etc, that&rsquo;s roughly what it comes to. Could be perhaps ±10% from country to country depending on their population, dominant industries and level of economic development.
</p>

<p>
In the 2012 federal budget, tax revenue was about 1.73 trillion USD.
However, total land values were 54 trillion USD, which is about 31 times more than the total tax revenue.
A land value tax of 3% would bring in almost 20% of all current revenue. This is just pure land value, as in what the land is worth, not including the improvements or buildings. If we were to combine it with other taxes, it would be an absolute tax boom.

<a href="../civilization/georgism-crash-course#space-utility-optimization-principle">The mathematical optimization behind Georgism is very sound</a>.
Another thing is that virtually all tax proposals have largely failed to benefit society in the past because they don&rsquo;t aim to reduce rent-seeking, they punish productivity in one form or another. Neither applies to LVT.

<p>
Georgism works because it uses free market principles.
We can&rsquo;t know how valuable land is we don&rsquo;t put a price on its monthly value.
The same cannot be said of the current system, where land values are not appraised on a regular basis, since people can own land for years and decades, no matter how inefficiently they may be using it.

I think this is missing a perspective that the free market itself is what determines value, not some kind of appraisal system, and it seems unfair to say that a free market is good for everything but land.

It doesn&rsquo;t correspond to a &rsquo;rate&rsquo; on the land&rsquo;s sale price as in a traditional property tax. The sale price itself is sensitive to taxation (you&rsquo;re not willing to pay as much to buy something you have to pay more tax on), and capturing 100% of the land rent would effectively drive the sale price to zero, making the traditional calculation useless. Therefore we need other methods of calculating what the land rent is, that don&rsquo;t depend on sales. Fortunately that is relatively straightforward and the statistical tools largely already exist.

<p>
There is no such thing as an &ldquo;unnecessary evil&rdquo; or a &ldquo;necessary evil&rdquo; because evil is not well-defined, and <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/07/what-is-morality.html">evil is an illusion</a>.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, there has never been a single civilization in human history that has managed to exist without some form of taxation. If civilization is to exist, then taxation is inevitable because a society can only eliminate what Libertarians call &ldquo;force&rdquo; by exerting it outwards and establishing the Rule of Law within the society.

So if taxation has to exist within a civilization, it&rsquo;s only logical that the least harmful and most widely recommended tax of them all should be used.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-authoritarianism-and-land-confiscation">
<p>
This belief is based on an incorrect understanding of what does and does not count as aggression.
An equal right to land is a negative right since land is not created by other people&rsquo;s labor.
It follows that everybody has an equal right to land, which is guaranteed by collecting LVT and using it to benefit the public.
Economically, it&rsquo;s also beneficial because if land is confiscated, then that means that the land is not being used to its maximum economic efficiency to the point where paying the LVT price is not a problem.
This is a <i>good</i> thing because then someone who will use the land to its fullest economic potential will have a fair chance to occupy it and use it too.
</p>

<blockquote>

Georgism would lead to unjust and uncompensated confiscations.

<p>
The same could be said for any form of government.
There is the possible concern that land values could be appraised in such a way that promotes corruption or cronyism, but this isn&rsquo;t a very good argument because prices have to be bootstrapped somehow.
If anything, implicit ad hoc pricing creates even more opportunities for corruption and evasion, in comparison to taxing natural resources at the point of extraction.
If the government doesn&rsquo;t set prices for natural resources, then markets won’t be bootstrapped, and we’ll have a tragedy of the commons. <a href="https://gameofrent.com/content/can-land-be-accurately-assessed">https://gameofrent.com/content/can-land-be-accurately-assessed</a>

<div id="outline-container-inherited-property" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="inherited-property"><span class="section-number-3">7.5.</span> But it&rsquo;s authoritarian to disrupt inherited property.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-inherited-property">
<p>
That claim is akin to the Divine Right of Kings, like a royal dynasty&rsquo;s ownership of land.
In order to ensure private ownership of land, you have to prevent other people from using it.
That&rsquo;s pretty authoritarian considering that the inheriters did no labor to create the land.
</p>

<p>
Whether or not LVT disrupting inheritance is &ldquo;authoritarian&rdquo; also depends on the inheritance.
To be clear, we&rsquo;re not against land being possessed by family generations.
We&rsquo;re only saying that they should pay LVT at the market price if they want to keep the land in the family.
</p>

<p>
Being related by blood is not a qualification for anything.
Society should be based on merit.
If people want to continue owning land that their ancestors owned, then there&rsquo;s no reason why they shouldn&rsquo;t have to pay the market price, just like everyone else.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
How does paying the market price show merit though? You can be wealthy and still lack merit.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Because Georgism would eliminate rent-seeking, wealth earned without generating wealth.
Georgists believe that <a href="../civilization/georgism-crash-course#GTP-vs-OATP">people should only be entitled to nothing but the fruits of their labor</a>.
Any wealth that people do have, would be earned by the fruits of their labor.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Do Georgists support inheritance? If a parent makes savings for their child&rsquo;s future, should that instead be taken by society and handed out &ldquo;equally&rdquo;?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The difference is that land is gained by preventing other people from using it.
If a child inherits money from their ancestors, they&rsquo;re not preventing anybody else from being able to earn money by the fruits of their labor.
You can&rsquo;t say the same thing about land.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
But everyone in a society inherits the land though?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I mean, you could argue that LVT is bad because so much of the middle class&rsquo;s retirement is dependent on the land speculation of their houses.
But that&rsquo;s not a good argument against LVT when considering the costs that that has for urban planning, pollution, economic efficiency, etc. The harms outweigh the benefits.

<p>
Main Article: <a href="../civilization/case-against-libertarianism#why-everybody-owns-land-equally">Why Everybody Owns Land Equally</a>.
</p>

<p>
It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to believe that land can be &rsquo;owned&rsquo;.
The idea that land can be &rsquo;owned&rsquo; is kind of weird. You didn&rsquo;t create it and You can&rsquo;t pick it up and move it like you could any other owned object.
Ownership in this sense is a bundle of rights that excludes everyone else and requires either everyone else to consent or the government to keep enforcing.
Yeah, you don&rsquo;t ever get to stop paying for those rights, but if it was otherwise, land ownership would just be about calling dibs on something nobody made and expecting the government to defend your rights in perpetuity, even if you aren&rsquo;t using it. Like, can I call dibs on the moon and expect NASA or ESA to kick anybody else&rsquo;s probes and rovers off? There is something fundamentally wrong with applying a Finder&rsquo;s Keepers System to land rights.
Land ownership is incredibly useful but philosophically isn&rsquo;t very different from calling dibs on the moon, and doesn&rsquo;t make much sense outside of community consenting to your rights in return for compensation.

<p>
No, not in the slightest.
A Socialist economy is when <b>Capital</b> is publicly owned, a Georgist economy is when <b>Land</b> is publicly owned while Labor and Capital are privately-owned, and a Communist economy is when all Three of Factors of Production (Labor, Capital, and Land) are publicly owned.
You can refer to the table for a concise comparison:

<p>
Note the following for what it means for each Factor of Production to be &ldquo;public&rdquo;:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;Land should be public&rdquo; = &ldquo;Land values should be equally distributed&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;Everybody should have equal access to Land&rdquo;.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Capital should be public&rdquo; = &ldquo;Seize the means of production&rdquo;.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Labor should be public&rdquo; = &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_needs">From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs</a>&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Basically, the distinction between whether each factor of production is public or private is whether it is owned by the state or owned by individual entities.
</p>

<p>
Unlike Capitalism, Socialism, and Communism, Georgism has never been tried before, and yet it is different from all of them, as it is the only one where everybody is guaranteed equal access to all Three of the Factors of Production.

This is not true. Georgism requires private land <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possession_(law)"><i>possession</i></a>, not private land <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership"><i>ownership</i></a>.
</p>

<p>
This is also wrong.
If Georgism was installed today and everybody owned land equally (while private possession is still maintained), then the difference would be that everybody receives a UBI after all government expenses are paid.
In essence, everybody would own the Earth&rsquo;s land equally because the value would be equally distributed to all citizens.

<h3 id="NRT-competitiveness"><span class="section-number-3">8.1.</span> Wouldn&rsquo;t a tax on natural resources make our country&rsquo;s natural resources more expensive and uncompetitive with world markets?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-NRT-competitiveness">
<p>
No, because this question assumes that natural resources would be privately owned and that the Natural Resources Tax would go on top of that, which is not the case at all under Georgism.
</p>

<p>
We already pay enormous corporations like British Petrol, De Beers, Sibanye Stillwater Limited, etc money when we buy natural resources from them. But under Georgism, natural resources would be owned by the government instead, and everybody would pay money (Natural Resources Tax) to the government to buy said natural resources, not the privately owned mega-corporations that shouldn&rsquo;t exist. Since the government would collect the revenue from selling natural resources instead of private corporations and no additional expenses would be added on top of that, Georgism would <i>not</i> make the country&rsquo;s natural resources less competitive on the global market.
</p>

<p>
Another point is that this would be even more impossible if there is a global government that manages the world&rsquo;s natural resources. The whole point of government is to resolve prisoner dilemmas and tragedies of the commons, so it is entirely reasonable to have a global government. The only criticisms that could be applied against a global government are ones that would also apply to national governments as well.
</p>

<p>
If we don&rsquo;t build a global government, a de facto global government will take form instead. Today, that is currently the United Nations, combined with the influence of the Chinese and American superpowers. So we might as well build a global government that is less likely to be a dumpster fire like the UN.
</p>

<p>
It is unreasonable to allow mega-corporations to profit billions of dollars just because they claimed that land first under a finders&rsquo; keepers system.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking">That is called rent-seeking</a>, and it doesn&rsquo;t contribute to economic growth at all.
If anybody is going to be making billions of dollars off of selling coal, oil, iron, copper, cobalt, natural gas, etc, it better be the government so that everybody else can pay fewer taxes (and maybe receive some welfare in return).

<div id="outline-container-cramming-fallacy" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="cramming-fallacy"><span class="section-number-3">8.2.</span> If you tax land value, then won&rsquo;t all the houses be crammed together and poorly built in order to use as little land as possible?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-cramming-fallacy">
<p>
Nope, that doesn&rsquo;t follow at all. LVT incentivizes building more housing. When you increase the supply of housing, you increase competition inside the market. Competition decreases prices and increases the quality of the goods and services available to the consumers.
</p>

<p>
It is also completely wrong to predict that all the houses and apartments would be crammed together. If anything, that&rsquo;s what you see / will see in the current system. Housing is so freaking expensive in Japan that there&rsquo;s literally coffin-sized apartments and POD hotels that people live inside of since they have no other choice. And the West is bound to head that road too in some areas if housing reform is not enacted.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, the vast majority of people don&rsquo;t want to live inside coffin-sized houses, so they&rsquo;d absolutely be okay with paying more LVT if that buys them more living space. And since landlords would have every incentive to get as many customers as possible, they would have to build something that people <i>want</i> to live in.
</p>

<p>
Clarification: The Land Value Tax is how we make land common property, by taxing away the economic advantage of ownership. Land in the Georgist context is everything belonging to the natural world, however sometimes land value tax isn&rsquo;t necessarily the best tax to use depending on the qualities of the thing belong to the natural world (we also talk about Harberger taxes, severance taxes, Pigouvian taxes, etc.), but it sometimes gets reduced down to &ldquo;The Single Tax on Land&rdquo; because to us Land is a factor of production that extends beyond the physical surface of the Earth.
</p>

<p>
Since LVT would make landlords pay the same amount of tax no matter how much or how little housing they build on the same plot of land, LVT would encourage landlords to build more housing. This would thus make housing more affordable everywhere, unlike property taxes which make housing more expensive by punishing landlords who build more housing. The result is that the cost of living would vary significantly less from one place to another, which would eliminate the need to adjust the UBI based on every location&rsquo;s cost of living.
