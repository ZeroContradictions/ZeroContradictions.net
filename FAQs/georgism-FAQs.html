<h2 id="switching-to-georgism"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Switching to Georgism</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-switching-to-georgism">
<p>
Any conversion over to a Georgist taxation system would have to be a very gradual process, taking at least 30 years in order to give everybody enough time to re-adjust their personal finances, especially for the people who are relying on land speculation as part of their retirement portfolio. But that&rsquo;s really the only drawback to Georgism. Once you&rsquo;re through that, it&rsquo;s smooth cruising from there on out.
</p>

<p>
The way how <a href="../misc/emacs-and-keyboard-setup.html#colemak">I was willing to switch from Qwerty to Colemak</a>, in spite of the 1-month transition period, is analogous to how I support Georgism, which would also require a transition period. Both provide better long-term results because they are both applications of the <a href="../economics/georgism-elevator-pitch.html#space-utility-optimization-principle">Space Utility Optimization Principle</a>.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, in order for Land Value Tax to be truly effective, it must be widespread, otherwise those not having to pay a land value tax will have an even bigger advantage. This is just like how states without income tax have an advantage in labor costs over states that do have income taxes, or how states without sales taxes have an advantage in sales over states that do have sales taxes. Likewise, if a Georgist government imposes taxes on negative externalities, like pollution, there would need to be a tariff on goods from countries which didn&rsquo;t impose such a tax. Otherwise you would just be subsidizing pollution elsewhere.

<h2 id="land-speculation"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Why is only land speculation bad, though? Why not also Sam Bankman-Fried style speculation?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-land-speculation">
<p>
I would say that any form of rent-seeking is undesirable for an economy and that there should be laws to prevent it whenever it occurs. I also oppose SBF-style speculation, but it&rsquo;s harder to make a case that that counts as rent-seeking. SBF-style speculation is more akin to gambling instead of investing since the speculators don&rsquo;t really own any true wealth and the risks are much higher. Gambling in small amounts won&rsquo;t hurt an economy, but it becomes a problem when it&rsquo;s done on the scale of the FTX scandal and a feedback loop is created.
</p>

<p>
If the stock market counted as rent, then that would effectively mean that there is no value in researching to distinguish between profitable investments and non-profitable investments. To an extent, the same could be said for land speculation, but the key difference between speculating on land versus speculating on a stock is that the former deprives everyone else of a natural resource in fixed supply, whereas the latter does not.
</p>

<p>
One of the problems with making a law against SBF-style speculation is that it can difficult to define and differentiate. It may just be better to let gamblers suffer the consequences of their actions. I oppose capital gains tax because stocks represents real wealth, are actual investments in a company, and actually have positive benefits on the economy.

<div id="outline-container-seasteading" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="seasteading"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Doesn&rsquo;t the existence of land reclamation and seasteading technologies refute your argument that &ldquo;land is finite&rdquo;?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-seasteading">
<p>
No, it doesn&rsquo;t. For one thing, this counter-argument against Georgism completely ignores the fact that we are <i>losing</i> more land due to rising sea levels than whatever land we could ever hope to gain with seasteading. Not only that, but seasteading is <i>extremely</i> expensive since it costs billions of dollars, and it could never produce enough land to go around for everybody. Thirdly, the seasteading argument also ignores that there wouldn&rsquo;t even be a need to seastead more land in the first place if we used the land that we already have more efficiently, which we could most practically accomplish via LVT.
</p>

<p>
And on top of all that, most land reclamation likely won&rsquo;t be permanent. Even though Incheon International Airport was built on reclaimed land, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak-kAdhh8-o">it has been slowly sinking at an alarming rate every year</a>, and this problem will be worsened further to some extent by climate change and rising sea levels. If the numbers are correct and this trend continues, then the airport is projected to sink below sea level within the next 100-200 years. This suggests that land reclamation probably won&rsquo;t be a permanent solution to land scarcity (at least the kind used to create more area for building the airport).

<h2 id="addressing-progressive-income-tax"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Why is Land Value Tax better than a progressive personal income tax?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-addressing-progressive-income-tax">
<p>
Income Tax is the sort of thing you would come up with if you were specifically trying to make the economy less efficient. Income taxes are among the worst of them all because they make labor more expensive and they punish productivity. Land is not created by labor though, so taxing land value does not punish productivity.

<h2 id="addressing-VAT"><span class="section-number-2">6.</span> Why is Land Value Tax better than Value Added Tax / Sales Tax?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-addressing-VAT">
<p>
It&rsquo;s pretty obvious that VAT would reduce economic activity by decreasing sales in the economy.

<div id="outline-container-why-LVT-better-than-property-taxes" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="why-LVT-better-than-property-taxes"><span class="section-number-2">7.</span> Why should we implement Land Value Taxes when we already have Property Taxes?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why-LVT-better-than-property-taxes">
<p>
Because Property Taxes make housing less affordable, whereas Land Value Taxes make more affordable. Property Taxes reduce the supply of housing (by making it more expensive to build housing), and since the tenants thus have fewer options/alternatives to choose from, this enables the landlords to pass the Property Taxes onto the tenants. This wouldn&rsquo;t happen at all with LVT though, because LVT would incentivize landlords to build <b>more</b> housing per square foot and they wouldn&rsquo;t get penalized for creating new floors on their land. Since LVT would increase the supply of housing, the tenants would have many many options to choose from in this buyers&rsquo; market, so LVT would <b>not</b> get passed onto the tenants.
</p>

<p>
And not only that, property taxes tax economic improvements to the land. Taxing economic improvements (which require human labor) make the economy less efficient because that would effectively be a tax on productivity, and thus higher undesirable.

<div id="outline-container-cramming-fallacy" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="cramming-fallacy"><span class="section-number-2">8.</span> If you tax land value, then won&rsquo;t all the houses be crammed together and poorly built in order to use as little land as possible?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-cramming-fallacy">
<p>
Nope, that doesn&rsquo;t follow at all. LVT incentivizes building more housing. When you increase the supply of housing, you increase competition inside the market. Competition decreases prices and increases the quality of the goods and services available to the consumers.
</p>

<p>
It is also completely wrong to predict that all the houses and apartments would be crammed together. If anything, that&rsquo;s what you see / will see in the current system. Housing is so freaking expensive in Japan that there&rsquo;s literally coffin-sized apartments and POD hotels that people live inside of since they have no other choice. And the West is bound to head that road too in some areas if housing reform is not enacted.
Obviously, the vast majority of people don&rsquo;t want to live inside coffin-sized houses, so they&rsquo;d absolutely be okay with paying more LVT if that buys them more living space. And since landlords would have every incentive to get as many customers as possible, they would have to build something that people <i>want</i> to live in.
</p>

<p>
Clarification: The Land Value Tax is how we make land common property, by taxing away the economic advantage of ownership. Land in the Georgist context is everything belonging to the natural world, however sometimes land value tax isn&rsquo;t necessarily the best tax to use depending on the qualities of the thing belong to the natural world (we also talk about Harberger taxes, severance taxes, Pigouvian taxes, etc.), but it sometimes gets reduced down to &ldquo;The Single Tax on Land&rdquo; because to us Land is a factor of production that extends beyond the physical surface of the Earth.
</p>

<p>
Since LVT would make landlords pay the same amount of tax no matter how much or how little housing they build on the same plot of land, LVT would encourage landlords to build more housing. This would thus make housing more affordable everywhere, unlike property taxes which make housing more expensive by punishing landlords who build more housing. The result is that the cost of living would vary significantly less from one place to another, which would eliminate the need to adjust the UBI based on every location&rsquo;s cost of living.

No it doesn&rsquo;t, and for several reasons:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Everybody has an equal negative right to land. If you disagree and you are going to argue in favor of <b>unequal</b> rights, then the burden of proof falls entirely on you to prove your claim since you would be arguing for <b>unequal</b> negative rights.

<li><a href="../journey/geolibertarian-arguments.hmtl#GTP">Anti-Georgism leads to an anti-free-market economy</a>, and that certainly isn&rsquo;t compatible with Libertarianism.</li>
<li>The NAP isn&rsquo;t as &ldquo;objective&rdquo; as Libertarians would like to believe. <a href="../journey/case-against-libertarianism.html#NAP">This list</a> shows a huge myriad of ways how Libertarians will disagree with each other, and it is evidence that Aggression is subjective, so the Libertarian Non-Aggression Principle is yet another subjective moral principle that does not form a basis for &ldquo;objective morality&rdquo;.</li>

<div id="outline-container-tax-unnecessary-evil" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="tax-unnecessary-evil"><span class="section-number-2">10.</span> But taxation is an unnecessary evil.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-tax-unnecessary-evil">
<p>
There is no such thing as an &ldquo;unnecessary evil&rdquo; or a &ldquo;necessary evil&rdquo; because evil is not well-defined, and <a href="../FAQs/post-overton-FAQs.html">evil is an illusion</a>.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, there has never been a single civilization in human history that has managed to exist without some form of taxation. If civilization is to exist, then taxation is inevitable because a society can only eliminate what Libertarians call &ldquo;force&rdquo; by exerting it outwards and establishing the Rule of Law within the society.
</p>

<p>
So if taxation has to exist within a civilization, it&rsquo;s only logical that the least harmful and most widely recommended tax of them all should be used.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-eminent-domain">
<p>
LVT would cause Eminent Domain to be less one-sided since more valuable properties would be more consenting to the eminent domain, since they would have to pay higher LVTs.
</p>

<p>
If the city collects a LVT and can also decide which land will get purposed for different things, it can essentially operate as a business, which should make it and all its operations run more efficiently.

<div id="outline-container-wealth-inequality" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="wealth-inequality"><span class="section-number-2">14.</span> How would Georgism reduce wealth inequality?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-wealth-inequality">
<p>
When everybody owns land equally, this ensures that everybody has equal access to the three factors of production: <b><b>Land</b></b>, Labor, and Capital. It follows that economic productivity is increased, and wealth inequality is dramatically reduced. The massive wealth inequality that exists today is in large part caused by the skewed and unequal ownership of highly valuable land.
</p>

<p>
Since the wealthiest people are naturally the ones who own the most land and the most valuable land, Land Value Tax would therefore reduce economic inequality, because the LVT would mostly fall on the wealthiest members of society.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, Georgism would make housing more affordable. When housing is unaffordable, it tends to affect the lower classes more than the upper classes, so that&rsquo;s another way how Georgism will reduce wealth inequality.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-not-socialist-nor-communist">
<p>
No, not in the slightest. A Socialist economy is when <b>Capital</b> is publicly owned, a Georgist economy is when <b>Land</b> is publicly owned while Labor and Capital are privately-owned, and a Communist economy is when all Three of Factors of Production (Labor, Capital, and Land) are publicly owned.

<div id="outline-container-taxes-on-natural-resources" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="taxes-on-natural-resources"><span class="section-number-2">16.</span> Why would natural resources be taxed under Georgism?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-taxes-on-natural-resources">
<p>
By taxing the economic inputs of the economy instead of the economic outputs, there would be incentives to use the inputs (Natural Resources) more efficiently, and we should absolutely want this since there is a fixed, finite amount of valuable land and natural resources on Earth. Likewise, people wouldn&rsquo;t get penalized for generating greater economic outputs.
</p>

<p>
Although location value taxation would be the main most dominant form of taxation, the taxation of the following would depend on how large the demand for those resources is, relative to the supply:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mineral Deposits</li>
<li>Forests</li>
<li>Fish Stocks</li>
<li>Geostationary Orbits</li>
<li>The Frequencies of the Electromagnetic Spectrum</li>
<li><a href="../economics/georgism-EPC-connection.html">Reproduction Licenses</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The economics is pretty easy to understand, provided that one has an understanding of supply and demand.

<div id="outline-container-farmers" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="farmers"><span class="section-number-2">17.</span> Wouldn&rsquo;t Land Value Tax Hurt Farmers?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-farmers">
<p>
Nope. Georgism would help everybody, including farmers.
</p>

<p>
Land Value Tax != Land Area Tax. Rural land tends to be worth far less per unit area than urban land, so it&rsquo;s not as big of a deal as you might think. For instance, in the United States, urban land constitutes less than 3% of the total land area but over 70% of the total rent (and thus potential LVT revenue). So farm land could only account for less than 30% of the total, which is a very small portion of the land rent, especially in proportion to its size. If anything, farmers might receive more money via the Citizen&rsquo;s Dividend than whatever that they might pay in LVT.
</p>

<p>
For another thing, LVT would: 1. densify suburbs that sprawl into farmland, and 2. tax land speculators. Both of these factors would only make rural land cheaper for farmers.

<div id="outline-container-NRT-competitiveness" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="NRT-competitiveness"><span class="section-number-2">19.</span> Wouldn&rsquo;t a tax on natural resources make our country&rsquo;s natural resources more expensive, and thus uncompetitive with world markets?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-NRT-competitiveness">
<p>
No, because this question assumes that natural resources would be privately owned and that the Natural Resources Tax would go on top of that, which is not the case at all under Georgism.
</p>

<p>
We already pay enormous corporations like British Petrol, De Beers, Sibanye Stillwater Limited, etc money when we buy natural resources from them. But under Georgism, natural resources would be owned by the government instead, and everybody would pay money (Natural Resources Tax) to the government to buy said natural resources, not the privately owned mega-corporations that shouldn&rsquo;t exist. Since the government would collect the revenue from selling natural resources instead of private corporations and no additional expenses would be added on top of that, Georgism would <i>not</i> make the country&rsquo;s natural resources less competitive on the global market.
</p>

<p>
Another point is that this would be even more impossible if there is a global government that manages the world&rsquo;s natural resources. The whole point of government is to resolve prisoner dilemmas and tragedies of the commons, so it is entirely reasonable to have a global government. The only criticisms that could be applied against a global government are ones that would also apply to national governments as well.
</p>

<p>
If we don&rsquo;t build a global government, a de facto global government will take form instead. Today, that is currently the United Nations, combined with the influence of the Chinese and American superpowers. So we might as well build a global government that is less likely to be a dumpster fire like the UN.
</p>

<p>
Surely you would have to agree with me on this point. It is utterly unreasonable to allow mega-corporations to profit billions of dollars just because they claimed that land first under a finders&rsquo; keepers system. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking">That is called rent-seeking</a>, and it doesn&rsquo;t contribute to economic growth at all. If anybody is going to be making billions of dollars off of selling coal, oil, iron, copper, cobalt, natural gas, etc, it better be the government so that everybody else can pay fewer taxes (and maybe receive some welfare in return).

<p>
It&rsquo;s true that you can build outwards instead up upwards if there is still uninhabited land available and the geography allows it, but it still remains the case that the supply of <b>valuable</b> locations within the jurisdiction is fixed.
</p>

<p>
Yes, there are millions of square kilometers of uninhabited land around the world, but asserting that ignores that not all of that land is equally valuable.
</p>

<p>
The problem is that if land is not taxed, there is no guarantee that it will be used as efficiently as possible. There&rsquo;s a huge difference between building a suburban style house in Manhattan versus building an apartment complex in the same location.
