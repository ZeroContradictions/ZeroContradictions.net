&ldquo;Anyone can prattle nonsense, and they&rsquo;ll always be able to find people to believe it, especially if they can dress it up in superstitious flummery. Careful reasoning and experience of the world are needed.&rdquo; -Wang Chong
</p>

<p>
People can find anything on Google that&rsquo;ll fit your their, even if its completely false. I can find on Google that 5G causes Covid, or Slenderman is a real entity.
</p>

<p>
Here is a list of bad advice that is commonly parroted, at least in western societies:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Do what you love / Follow your passion -This is wrong because it is said by people who are already passionate about doing what they do, so it sets an impossible high bar for everyone else. Every complex society will inevitably have jobs that no one particularly wants to do, yet someone has to do those jobs. So if every single person was doing what they absolutely love in life, then it is unlikely that the world economy would continue to function properly. A better way to think about life is like fishing. Some spots are beautiful to you and will help you catch fish, but other spots won&rsquo;t, but you can&rsquo;t know where you would like to spend time until you go there and you can&rsquo;t know how many fish you will catch there until you try. The younger you are, the more time you can spend sailing to different spots and the older you are, the more time you get to spend in places you know you like, refining your abilities to catch fish there.</li>
<li>Sometimes we have to follow reason, other times we have to follow emotion. -This is completely unreasonable and because reason should <i>always</i> be followed. Emotions are bad for making decisions.</li>
<li>The strongest are the ones that can forgive. -This is not true because forgiveness must be earned. It should never be given to those who don&rsquo;t deserve it. Also, forgiving isn&rsquo;t inherently a good thing since it depends on the circumstances surrounding the forgiveness.</li>
<li>We should let children decide for themselves on religion and such -We don’t let kids decide for themselves when it comes to playing in the road, visiting the creepy uncle, playing with matches, doing meth, petting the venomous snake, etc.</li>
<li>Remaining friends with an ex makes you a stronger person because it is better to remain friends than strangers.</li>
<li>Staying friends with your ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend is a sign of strength -Unless you both mutually agreed to end the relationship that you both once had on good terms, it is always a bad idea to stay friend with your ex for a very long list of reasons, stated here [insert link to list of reasons]. In every other case, the healthiest to do after a relationship ends is to have a period of no contact for how ever long it is necessary. Unless you can resolve the following set of conditions, only then might it be a good idea to stay friends after a period of no contact.</li>
<li>Breakfast is the most important meal of the day -There is no evidence that skipping breakfast by itself will make a person less healthy. Studies that reach this conclusion have been funded by breakfast companies, might have had their results exaggerated (like the Harvard study), or may have failed to account for correlations. Thus they have made a Correlation Implies Causation Fallacy. Although people that skip breakfast tend to be less healthy, this is because they tend to do other unhealthy stuff too like smoking, not exercising, and other bad health decisions. When people wake up, they should eat when they&rsquo;re hungry, and if they&rsquo;re not hungry, then they should eat later.</li>
<li>A lot of dating and attraction advice, especially some of the stuff floating on the web and being sold for profit -the problem is that this advice generalizes everything to a single person, and can&rsquo;t account for the billions of <b>different</b> people that live on this planet. And then there&rsquo;s other bad advice that suggests playing mind games, which are stupid because they prevent one from achieving the virtue of communication. Fortunately though, there is some actually good advice out there, like be yourself and ideas for dates.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID Programming Heuristics</a> -There is no evidence that these heuristics produce code that is cleaner, higher-performing or easier to read. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YpFGkG-u1w">This video</a> does a great job of debunking it.</li>
<li>The Blue Pill Narrative -The Black Pill is the best of all the pill dating/attraction ideologies. Furthermore, a lot of or most media in the modern world over-idealizes romantic relationships. For the vast majority of people, there is no truly perfect partner that they could viably date. Instead, you date the people whose downsides you can live with day to day.</li>
<li>Only purchase from plumbers / electricians / handyman / etc that are certified -Once again, society places too high of an emphasis of certification. The only thing that should matter is that they are insured, so that if they do mess up, then both sides don&rsquo;t lose out. In fact, an unlicensed handyman could be worse than a licensed one, which reaffirms the fact that only insurance matters.</li>
<li>There is always room for improvement -This isn&rsquo;t necessarily the case if one is the best of the best or something is the best that it could be. Perhaps a more accurate saying would be &ldquo;There is usually / often room for improvement&rdquo;. The &rsquo;always&rsquo; might be added in here since it makes it a phrase for people to casually say to other people in the art of conversation.</li>
<li>The participation trophy argument -This is something that is talked about a lot by people and the news media when there is actually very little evidence to prove that it actually happens in reality. I have not seen ANY identified evidence that giving trophies for participation is widespread and common these days, or that even happens at all.</li>
<li>Those who fail to study history are doomed to repeat it -Although this is a popular saying, the benefits for studying history generally stem from avoiding historical mistakes. The better reasons for why we actually learn history are&#x2026;</li>
<li>There are no risks to masturbation -This is not true. If a male masturbates incorrectly, he could potentially develop Peyronie&rsquo;s Disease. Unfortunately, knowledge about this unfortunate possibility isn&rsquo;t told to a lot of males before it&rsquo;s too late since masturbation is rather taboo and statements like this one don&rsquo;t acknowledge that masturbation can be harmful if it is done incorrectly.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Time heals all wounds&rdquo; -Time heals many wounds since most people can&rsquo;t stay mad forever, but it would be factually incorrect to say that time can heal <i>all</i> wounds. There are some wounds that can never be healed.</li>
<li>Philosophy is useless -Unfortunately, there are many people that believe this. These people either don&rsquo;t understand what philosophy is and/or haven&rsquo;t looked far enough into it to form a philosophy that makes sense.</li>
<li>True love never dies -All love is conditional, so if someone does something to break the condition, then it is very conceivable if someone else stops loving them.</li>
<li>If you truly love someone that doesn&rsquo;t want to have kids when you do want to have kids, then you would still stay with them -This neglects the fact that the purpose of a relationship is for one to satisfy their needs, whatever those needs might be.</li>
<li>The Vim Vs Emacs Flame War -Although some tools are probably more efficient than others (depending on how much time you put into learning how to use them), at the end of the day the only thing that really matters is that you know how to use your tools and they are efficient for what you want to do.</li>
<li>Anything that gives the traditional lore and fluff of saying how great an option is without providing evidence -This statement is kind of vague, but I&rsquo;m talking about situations like:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Standard College Recruitment Lore:</li>
<li>Standard Interviewee Lore Said To Interviewers/Employers:</li>
<li>Standard Product Advertisement Lore Shown To Consumers:</li>
<li>My bottom line here is that if you really want to show people that you or whatever you&rsquo;re trying to sell is worth buying/looking into, you have to SHOW them. Actions speak louder than words.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Trying to cram new activities/obligations into one&rsquo;s schedule without understanding that you have to spend less time doing other things that aren&rsquo;t as valuable -&#x2026;</li>
<li>About maybe half of all the quotes that get thrown around today -There are far too many of them to state, but there is a countless list of quotes that get thrown around when they don&rsquo;t actually mean anything if you think about them critically under the guide of a rational philosophy.</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t know the meaning of a word in a sentence, you can use context clues to help you learn and understand the meaning of the word -Although it is important to know what context clues are from a young age (when a child is first learning how to read), their importance is often over-emphasized, at least in the education that I had received. In most cases, I felt that unless the author made a conscious effort to embed definitions, synonyms, antonyms, examples, etc. into their sentences, context clues weren&rsquo;t very helpful. Unless the author put great thought into making the vocabulary of their stories easy to understand from reading the story itself, there was no way to truly understand the definition of the unknown words being used. At best I could get a broad, general meaning that ignores other possible definitions of the word or sometimes I could understand what the sentence meant but misunderstand the definition of the word. Especially when someone advances very far into their education (secondary or post-secondary), context clues are hardly helpful at all since the words and discourse community jargon is to complex and/or esoteric to understand without encountering the definition.</li>
<li>Word of the Day -It is generally better to learn words naturally as you come across you instead of just shoving a word in your face and expecting you to remember it.</li>
<li>This Myers-Briggs personality type INTP likes good working conditions -Who doesn&rsquo;t like good working conditions? That doesn&rsquo;t tell us anything about this type, and is one of many things that reaffirms that Myers-Briggs personality testing is a pseudoscience.</li>
<li>Dyslexia is when people read the words backwards -Although this is the case for many dyslexic people, it is <i>very</i> incorrect to generalize this to <i>all</i> dyslexic people. There are many different forms and different degrees of dyslexia.</li>
<li>There is something to learn from everybody -At minimum, it only takes just one counterexample out of billions of people to prove this wrong. And there are probably at least millions maybe even a couple billion or more people from whom the smartest human beings or even smarter-than-average humans wouldn&rsquo;t have anything to learn from. Since millions to billions of humans all have the same lifestyle, education, major life choices, and/or surrounding circumstances, lots of people&rsquo;s advice would become quite similar and repetitive.</li>
<li>Happiness is a choice; positivity is a mindset; gratitude is the path to both. -i</li>
<li>If you tell just one lie, then you will tell more lies -This isn&rsquo;t necessarily true because it depends on the context. There are situations where telling just one lie will be the last lie, and there are other situations where even more lies have to be made in order to make the first lie seem consistent with reality.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Although schools don&rsquo;t teach how to write in cursive anymore, there was never any good reason for them to spend so much instruction and practice time teaching an obsolete skill in the first place, compared to all the other things that children could and should be learning. Dedicating time to typing instead is more practical.</li>
<li>Fact: In the long run, training wheels actually don&rsquo;t make it easier to learn how to ride a balance bike. They make it arguably harder since training wheels don&rsquo;t require counter steering to steer, whereas balance bikes do. So when the training wheels are removed and one must learn how to ride a balance bicycle, one has to unlearn turning and relearn how to turn (this time with counter-steering for balancing the bicycle).</li>
