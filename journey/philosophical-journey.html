<h2 id="my-introduction-to-philosophy"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> How I First Got Interested In Philosophy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-my-introduction-to-philosophy">
<p>
The first serious philosophical questions I ever asked were political ones, starting around 17 years old. I&rsquo;ve been Atheist for as long as I can remember, and I started out as a mainstream right-winger because my parents raised me that way and it felt more coherent and less contradictory than being left-wing.
</p>

<p>
In my junior year of high school, I was shown a 2-minute video on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory">black swans</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a> during an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_knowledge_(IB_course)">IB Theory of Knowledge</a> class. Although TOK does a very poor job at being a philosophy class, this was one of the better ideas introduced in the class. I would rate the school day that I had watched that video as being the most important day within my entire K-12 education. I definitely took that video and the ensuing discussion on confirmation bias much more seriously than anybody else in my class, as nobody else had significantly changed their beliefs over the years. Before watching that video, I used to use lots of confirmation bias for justifying my conservative political beliefs and many of my other sentimental assumptions. It felt like that my brain was melting the first time that I had to admit that I was wrong about something, but after that, it became much easier to admit when I was wrong about something. I soon realized that when I&rsquo;m able to admit that I&rsquo;m wrong, that means that I can stop being wrong and start being right instead.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after I graduated high school and turned 18 years old, I became right-libertarian. While I would now consider Libertarianism to be mostly a utopian ideology, it seemed like a step in the right direction at the time since I was rejecting societal norms that everyone else took for granted. I didn&rsquo;t seriously started thinking about philosophy as a whole (including metaphysics, epistemology, etc) until I turned 19 years old when I was introduced to Ayn Rand&rsquo;s philosophy of Objectivism.
</p>

<p>
As for how I discovered Objectivism and subsequently got into philosophy, after my first break up, I felt depressed and I was searching the internet for answers. Some guy on Quora started talking about &ldquo;Philosophy of Love&rdquo;. I had heard the noun phrase &ldquo;Libertarian Philosophy&rdquo; before since I was already Libertarian at that point, but seeing the word &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; being used in that particular context caused me to google verbatim &ldquo;Libertarian Philosophy&rdquo;, and I came across this website in my google search results: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220218185331/http://www.groundedlibertarian.com/">http://www.groundedlibertarian.com/</a>.
</p>

<p>
Before I came across that website, I had the really terrible and inaccurate understanding that philosophy was simply a boring subject that consisted of nothing but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem">train-track problems</a> because that&rsquo;s basically how philosophy was always presented to me: trolley problems and pointless ethical questions that have no meaningful application in the real world. On the other hand, the way that website was written immediately caught my attention, and when my eyes were glazing over all the links, I realized &ldquo;Oh, so that&rsquo;s what philosophy actually is. Why have I never bothered to think about something that is so interesting!&rdquo;
</p>

<h2 id="ancap-phase"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> How I Became An Ancap, And How I Eventually Rejected It</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-ancap-phase">
<p>
I was firmly minarchist after being introduced to Objectivism, but I became anarcho-capitalist a few months later after watching Larken Rose&rsquo;s youtube channel. Ayn Rand had misguided me into believing in objective morality, and Larken Rose had further misguided me into believing that: 1. all political authority is illegitimate, 2. that taxation is essentially equivalent is slavery, 3. an anarchist (Voluntaryist) society would have less violence than one ruled by a state, 4. future societies would look down upon government the same way people today look down on slavery, etc.
</p>

<p>
So I became an Ancap for about the next 1-2 years, and I look back on that period with great cringe. Several hundreds of hours were wasted thinking about the wrong / non-existent problems and asking moral questions that actually lead nowhere (which I refer to as &ldquo;endlessly running around in circles&rdquo;). And like other Utopian Ideologists, I was consuming Internet content that only reaffirmed the moral superiority that I thought I had. I was so obsessed with objective morality that I even briefly became vegan for about 5 months within that time, until I realized that veganism was unhealthy, impractical, and full of contradictions.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, a majority of the time that I spent during those period was actually put to good use since I was mainly focused on college, and I was making some progress in thinking about epistemology. In September 2019, I was introduced to Efilism, which did improve my philosophy to an extent since I became more aware that: 1. life is violent, 2. <a href="../epistemology/free-will.html">free will (as I had defined it) did not exist</a>, and 3. <a href="../epistemology/axiology.html">value is subjective</a>. These were arguably the first cracks in my support for Anarcho-Capitalism, which I fully rejected in October 2020.
</p>

<p>
Around early 2021, I started questioning whether morality was truly objective or not. I was looking around at all sorts of different ideological subreddits that had completely different morals from one another. I wasn&rsquo;t morally dogmatic since I wasn&rsquo;t an Ancap anymore, so I was viewing all the different ideological communities as more of a sociologist or descriptive ethicist (&ldquo;What do people think is right?&rdquo;). The more I thought about it in my observations, the more and more it seemed that morality wasn&rsquo;t objective. I think I probably could&rsquo;ve eventually figured this out independently, but it would&rsquo;ve taken longer (a year at most I&rsquo;m guessing). I already knew that value was subjective, so the last pair of dots I would&rsquo;ve had to connect is that morality is based on values, not reason. Just because something is &ldquo;moral&rdquo;, that doesn&rsquo;t make it reasonable, and vice versa. And even though one&rsquo;s subjective morality <i>should</i> be reasonable (in the sense that one&rsquo;s values should not contradict each other), that doesn&rsquo;t conclude that objective morality exists (more on this in: <a href="../epistemology/axiology.html">Axiology: The Nature of Value</a>).

<div id="outline-container-becoming-georgist" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="becoming-georgist"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> How I Became Georgist</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-becoming-georgist">
<p>
When I first heard of Georgism, I was bitterly opposed to it because it was in opposition to the Ancap ethics that I had. But when I saw Ancaps debating against Georgists on Reddit, I noticed that the Georgists always had better arguments that were more economically detailed than the Ancaps. Eventually the Ancaps would give up arguing against the Georgists because the Georgists always had a better counter-argument and then some. u/Haestrod in particular was really knowledgeable, and he was always willing to go the long haul in these text debates. Prior to learning about Georgism, I never realize how important urban planning was. I was never taught anything about it in school, and since I was Libertarian in college, I was inclined to believe that urban planning wasn&rsquo;t worth studying since it was controlled by governments and partially structured according to various taxation schemas, which I thought were evil at the time.
</p>

<p>
The only reason why I was ever opposed to taxation in the first place was because it deprives people of the fruits of their labor. But land is <i>not</i> created by labor, so LVT is not a true tax and is actually a misnomer since Land Value Taxes don&rsquo;t deprive people of the fruits of their labor (when only the unimproved value of the land is taxed, otherwise it would be called a property tax). After connecting these two facts in my mind, I had to seriously question why I was against Land Value Tax at all in the first place, and it created cognitive dissonance for me:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Taxation is slavery with extra steps if it deprives people of the fruits of their Labor.</li>
<li>Land is not created by Labor.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Conclusion: Land Value Taxes are not theft nor slavery because Land is not created by Labor.
</p>

<p>
After I realized this, I started seriously investigating Georgism and why some people supported it, and now I&rsquo;ve been Georgist ever since.
</p>

<p>
In hindsight, The best earliest time to have introduced me to Georgism would&rsquo;ve been right after I graduated high school, before or around the same time that I became Libertarian, since I didn&rsquo;t any reasons to oppose taxation and I was in search of another political ideology to identify with since I didn&rsquo;t feel at home with I had believed then. It&rsquo;s much less likely that I ever would&rsquo;ve had an Anarchist phase if I had become Georgist beforehand.

<h3 id="5-years-old"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> How I First Recognized The Problems Of Anti-Georgism As A 5-Year-Old</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-years-old">
<p>
When I was a 5-year-old kid who didn&rsquo;t know anything economics, urban planning, or political science, I could tell that land speculation didn&rsquo;t make any sense, even before I knew what the term itself was called and how the phenomenon works, based on the effects that it caused to the urban planning of my surroundings.
</p>

<p>
In the town where I grew up, I always wondered why there were vacant acres of land laying around here and there in between all the houses, businesses, parks, etc. All these vacant swaths of land also had these huge signs on them with phone numbers of who to contact if someone would like to buy the land. But as a child and a teenager, I didn&rsquo;t think much about this phenomenon, besides wondering, &ldquo;Why do all these empty spaces need to be between everything? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to build everything closer together so that there would be shorter distances to drive between?&rdquo; For context, my parents and I would often spend a couple of hours traveling around the metropolitan area on some days, and it always felt like it took so long to get from point A to point B. I naturally recognized that it wouldn&rsquo;t have to take so much time to travel from one place to another if all the buildings and places were built more closely together, i.e. if there was less urban sprawl around the metropolitan area and less plots of idle land that had nothing but billboards on them.
</p>

<p>
When I finally learned about Georgism as a young adult, I finally understood what was going on. Not only were all these land speculators ruining the town&rsquo;s urban planning and creating lots of urban sprawl, but since their unused land was gaining value from the community&rsquo;s labor without them having to do any work themselves, this was a form of invisible yet socially acceptable theft (AKA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking">rent-seeking</a>). Alloidal libertarians are able to recognize that inflation is a form of invisible theft, and yet they turn a blind eye to land speculation which also extracts other people&rsquo;s labor into the hands of just a few, yet differently. I talk more about how my newly acquired understanding of Georgism and Land Economics was the first issue that caused me to become disillusioned from mainstream Right-Libertarianism in <a href="../journey/geolibertarian-arguments.hmtl">this blog post here.</a>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-efilism-phase">
<p>
In November 2018, I came across a random person on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitStatistsSay">r/ShitStatistsSay</a> who claimed that giving birth to children violates the NAP because the parents are creating the child without their consent. Now of course, since r/ShitStatistsSay is yet another one of those <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-communists-who-took-power-in.html?view=classic">Utopian Ideology</a> echo chambers, that reddit user who spoke out (and popped my bubble in the process) got downvoted to oblivion by all the morally-righteous Libertarians and Ancaps hanging around on that sub.
</p>

<p>
However, I didn&rsquo;t downvote him (even though I was inclined to disagree), and I thought it was intellectually dishonest that everybody else was ruthlessly attacking that guy with nothing but insults and Ad Hominem Fallacies. I thought he had a legitimate criticism against a socially-acceptable practice that violates the NAP. Since he brought up Antinatalism, I decided to check out the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/">r/Antinatalism</a> subreddit further. I thought Antinatalism was a very interesting and eye-opening way of looking at the world. I came up with my own subjective arguments against it (which I thought were objective at the time), but Antinatalism always sat in the back of my mind after hearing about it. At that point, I did briefly see Inmendham&rsquo;s Efilist youtube channel, but he had literally thousands of videos and they were all so long, I couldn&rsquo;t grasp what he was talking about from just glazing over all his video thumbnails and titles. I understood that Efilism was pro-antinatalism, but if Inmendham had just placed a summary description of what he believed in somewhere where I would&rsquo;ve seen it, I would&rsquo;ve found out what Efilism actually is about a year earlier. Note that this is one reason why I am adamant that my blog should have descriptions of what it&rsquo;s linking on the homepage, so that the links can catch people attention and give them a peak into what the linked content talks about.
</p>

<p>
In September 2019, I had another periodic moment where I was wondering about antinatalism again, and I came across the <a href="https://archive.org/details/wiki-efilismfandomcom">Efilism Fandom Wiki</a> written by TheLordSatanX (the original site was taken down by Fandom.com, but that link shows an archived version of what it showed). At that point, I finally understood that Efilism is a full-blown philosophy comprised of reductive physicalism, determinism, unintelligent design, acknowledgment of wild animal suffering and biological zero sum games, extreme negative utilitarianism, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_utilitarianism#The_benevolent_world-exploder">pro-Benevolent-World-Exploder</a>, and so on. While Ancaps reject and ignore the violent nature of life because they&rsquo;re ignorant and privileged to have grown up in a relatively safe environment created by the Rule of Law, Efilists don&rsquo;t overlook the intrinsic violence of nature at all and they talk about it all the time, so discovering Efilism created a lot of contrast in my thinking.
</p>

<p>
I became vegan in July 2019 and became anti-vegan in January 2020 (after I found out how damaging it can potentially be to one&rsquo;s health). Since I became vegan independently of Antinatalist and Efilist influences, it resonated with me that Efilists also happen to coincidentally support veganism. I agreed with Efilism on so many philosophical issues, and this gave me the strong fear that Efilism might be the objective standard that I had been chasing after. It was very depressing to think that there was a seemingly strong possibility that the most reasonable and morally objective thing for me to do would be to throw away everything I had worked towards up to that point in my life, and devote myself towards the cause of destroying the Earth. Efilism made me feel nihilistic and depressed to an extent since I didn&rsquo;t have any good arguments against it at the time, and this was especially frustrating since Efilism goes against my biological intuitions.
</p>

<p>
But at the same time, I really hoped that there was just something out there to prove that Efilism is actually not the morally objective standard. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to have children and hope that the human race continue among the stars. I wasn&rsquo;t able to firmly reject Efilism until I read <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/07/what-is-morality.html?view=classic">this essay</a> and decisively determined that morality is not objective, and I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J69r9Xe6PFA">Blithering Genius&rsquo;s video critiquing Efilism</a>. This made me very happy since I finally had a philosophy that didn&rsquo;t contradict my own desires and biological intuitions.

NOTE: I will start writing this section later when I have more time. In comparison to how many drastic changes have been made to my political beliefs over time, my epistemology has been relatively stable by comparison.

<h2 id="timeline-summary-of-changes"><span class="section-number-2">6.</span> Timeline Summary Of Changes To My Philosophy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-timeline-summary-of-changes">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>2016 July: I start questioning whether my political beliefs are true or not. At this point, I was a very enthusiastic Trump supporter, but I was too young to vote for him in the 2016 election.</li>
<li>2017 June 30: I discovered the website for the US Libertarian Party, and from that point on, I decided that I was a Libertarian instead of a Conservative.</li>
<li>2017 August: I start attending college as a double major in Linguistics and Computer Science.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>2018 January 6: My girlfriend broke up with me because she didn&rsquo;t understand her own emotions. It&rsquo;s complicated, but my post on <a href="../epistemology/extended-tetris-effect.html">the Extended Tetris Effect</a> talks about how all the media and information that we consume everyday can distort our perceptions of reality.</li>
<li>2018 April 13: My ex-girlfriend starts dating an ex-boyfriend of hers who is twice my age. I felt really depressed and unsure of how to move on with my life, until I discovered the groundedlibertarian.com in my Google search results. As I skimmed over all the website pages at this point, I realized what philosophy actually is, and since then, thinking about philosophy has become my favorite pastime.</li>
<li>2018 June-August: I finished reading all the pages on the Grounded Libertarian website.</li>
<li>2018 October: I change my college major from Computer Science to Mathematics.</li>
<li>2018 November: I discovered Larken Rose&rsquo;s Youtube Channel, and became an Anarchist (Voluntaryist / Anarcho-Capitalist).</li>
<li>2018 November: I first discovered Anti-Natalism for the first time, and I didn&rsquo;t feel that my arguments against it were very good,</li>
<li>2019: I make a lot of progress in thinking and theorizing about epistemology. My political philosophy doesn&rsquo;t change much, but I did have some cognitive dissonance when thinking about the Georgist&rsquo;s arguments in favor of LVT.</li>
<li>2019 September: I discovered the Efilism Wiki, and learned what Efilism is. It had a considerable impact on my philosophy.</li>
<li>2020 February: I apprehended that determinism and materialism are both true, after being persuaded by the pages that I read on the Efilist Wiki.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>2020 July: I discover David Pearce&rsquo;s Hedonistic Imperative, which gave me some hope that there might be a better alternative to Efilism and the Benevolent World Exploder.</li>
<li>2020 September: I came up with the current <a href="../epistemology/2B-performative-contradictions.html">axiomatization system for my philosophy</a> (which is still subject to change).</li>
<li>2020 October 13: I accepted Georgism and LVT, which was the start of my first divergence from Libertarianism and Anarchism.</li>
<li>2020 October: I realized the importance of geopolitics and that they are an inescapable reality, from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CaspianReport/videos">Caspian Report&rsquo;s Youtube Channel</a>,</li>
<li>2020 November: Thinking about how LVT would improve urban planning caused me to recognize the importance of Urban Planning, from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CityBeautiful/videos">City Beautiful&rsquo;s Youtube Channel</a>,</li>
<li>2020 November: After thinking about democracy and political campaigns near the 2020 presidential election, I concluded that protecting individual by private defense corporations (political corporations in Ancapistan) would only replace political parties with corporations, ones that would use the same statistics and data analysis techniques used to win Obama&rsquo;s 2008 presidential campaign. I talk about some of this in my post: <a href="../journey/case-against-libertarianism.html#polycentric-law-problems">The Problems Concerning Polycentric Law</a></li>
<li>2021 February: I discerned that exclusively relying on a free market of private defense corporations and other private entities to protect individual rights is a circular reasoning fallacy because a free marketplace cannot exist if individual rights aren&rsquo;t already protected in the first place.</li>
<li>2021 February-October: I was viewing different ideologies and various different conceptions of &ldquo;right&rdquo; and &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;, more so as a sociologist rather than a moral dogmatist. I was questioning if morality is truly objective, and to what extent that it might be subjective.</li>
<li>2021 August: I graduate from college with a Mathematics BS and a Linguistics BA.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>2021 October 16: I grasped that morality is relative and why that&rsquo;s the case, from reading Blithering Genius&rsquo;s blog post <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/07/what-is-morality.html?view=classic">&ldquo;What is Morality?&rdquo;</a>. I found Blithering Genius&rsquo;s Youtube channel when I saw that he made a video talking about Adam Lanza, and this caught my eye because he was one of the very few people on the Internet that was talking about this.</li>
<li>2021 October 17: I watched Blithering Genius&rsquo;s video critiquing Efilism, and for the first time ever, I firmly rejected Efilism, and this made me very happy since I finally had a philosophy that didn&rsquo;t contradict my own desires and biological intuitions.</li>
<li>2021 October-December: I decided that undesirable biological and evolutionary realities would take over in the absence of government intervention.</li>
<li>2021 November 8: I started reading the blog posts on <a href="https://stateofthenihil.wordpress.com/">StateOfTheNihil&rsquo;s Blog</a>, and it particularly influences my thinking on the Laws of Formal Logic and the solution of the Münchhausen Trilemma.</li>
<li>2021 December - 2022 January: I spent a lot of time reading Blithering Genius&rsquo;s books &ldquo;On the Edge&rdquo; and &ldquo;Immanentizing the Abyss&rdquo;, watching his Youtube videos, and reading blog posts that were not published in his books. I definitely wasn&rsquo;t Libertarian anymore after reading and accepting all the new ideas that I had been introduced to.</li>
<li>2022 February: I realized the connection between <a href="../economics/georgism-EPC-connection.html">Georgism and EPC</a>.</li>
<li>2022 August-November: I start working on this website. I made progress converting all the text files talking about my philosophical thoughts and beliefs over the past four years into blog posts that are now displayed on this blog, and updated when I have the time to elaborate and expand on what I have already written.</li>
