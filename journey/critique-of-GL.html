<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is the website that got me thinking about philosophy when I was 19 years old.</li>
<li>It is a website that summarizes Ayn Rand&rsquo;s philosophy of Objectivism.</li>
<li>The website is no longer available, but an archive of what it was is available at this link: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220218185331/http://www.groundedlibertarian.com/">https://web.archive.org/web/20220218185331/http://www.groundedlibertarian.com/</a></li>
<li>I am critiquing it to show how my personal philosophy has changed over the years, the fallacies and errors of Ayn Rand&rsquo;s philosophy, and the problems with Libertarian ethical and political philosophy.</li>
<li>I doubt most people would this interesting compared to my other content and the external links that are accessible on this blog&rsquo;s homepage, but one of the main reasons why I&rsquo;m writing this blog post is that it&rsquo;s intended as a criticism of Objectivism and why it&rsquo;s not a good philosophy.</li>
</ul>

<p>
NOTE: I still need to reformat this file, but when I&rsquo;m done reformatting it, the .html will quote a sections of text from the website, with each quote followed by my commentary criticizing or debunking what was written on the website.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-free-will">
<blockquote>
<p>
GROUNDED LIBERTARIAN COMMENTARY I: Just like with the 3 axioms and the validity of the senses, we can&rsquo;t &ldquo;prove&rdquo; we have volition; it&rsquo;s self-evident, and precedes proof. If this seems like a cop out, it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s self-evident because it&rsquo;s arrived at by observing our own consciousness at work. By reading this passage and thinking, you realize you can focus, or choose not to focus. There is always the option. If you can&rsquo;t grasp that fact then there&rsquo;s nothing me or anyone else can do to convince you. The mere act of beginning to prove volition shows you have it. Just like with the 3 axioms, you either accept them or you don&rsquo;t, but if even if you don&rsquo;t, you will end up showing them true if you go down the path trying to disprove them.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The problem here is that the Grounded Libertarian is proving that we have free will, in the sense that we can do as we want.
</p>

<p>
However, it does not prove that we have free will, in the sense that we aren&rsquo;t deterministic. Everything in the universe behaves deterministically due to its cause and effect nature. Likewise, it is deterministic that human life will do as it pleases, as per its deterministic biological programming and its unchangeable past experiences (everything that happened in the past is unchangeable). Since humans always do as they want according to these two factors, which correspond to nature and nurture, it should be clear that humans act deterministically according to deterministic influences.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
GROUNDED LIBERTARIAN COMMENTARY II: Determinism means that we have no independent control over our thoughts and actions, and we are like robots (or snails), automatically reacting to the world with no choice of our own, and no power to alter our course in the world. What we might think of as choices are just an illusion. While some romantics seem to fancy this notion, it&rsquo;s only because they don&rsquo;t think it through. This would obliterate concepts like right and wrong, morality, virtue, and ironically, love itself. You could never hold anyone accountable for their actions, as they had no choice in the matter! Try this idea on your spouse next time you screw up and see how it goes! Like all fallacies, the notion of determinism collapses in on itself, as how can something is true (like determinism) when you have no ability to think independently and interpret reality? If you follow determinism to its logical end, there is no way to know anything (including determinism!)as we have no choice in the matter. Just like with the axioms of existence, consciousness and identity, refuting volition is nonsensical. You have to accept it in order to refute it!
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If we truly had free will, then we wouldn&rsquo;t be influenced by external factors because we would make our own thoughts independently.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It&rsquo;s precisely because people don&rsquo;t have free will what people should be held accountable when they understood what they did, in order to discourage this behavior in the future or serve as an example. If people truly had free will, such environmental factors wouldn&rsquo;t influence them.</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t give negative feedback for when people do bad, you create an environment where they have no deterrence from doing bad stuff.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Why should evil people strive for good virtues and love if their behavior will ultimately be determined by deterministic factors, and it is thus pointless/impossible for them to try?
</p>

<p>
Because they still have the capacity to strive for good virtues due to the second definition of free will. We won&rsquo;t know if they can be good until/unless they try, that&rsquo;s why they should always try. Their actions are determined by their genetics, their philosophy, and their past experiences. Even if they have bad genetics, we can still use the other factors to condition them to be good.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
GROUNDED LIBERTARIAN COMMENTARY III: If we are determined, then there is no ability to think independently, and thus no ability to know what&rsquo;s true. After all, we have no choice, right? So, both the advocates of determinism and the advocates of free will are helpless to choose what they believe in. Neither have any ability to understand the truth, and thus it&rsquo;s pointless to go any further in the debate. We don&rsquo;t have any independent control over learning concepts, as it&rsquo;s automatic, so the study of epistemology is useless. Why study a subject that answers if our knowledge is valid? Why study any subject? Philosophically, it&rsquo;s a dead end, and leads to nonsensical and harmful ideas in subsequent branches of philosophy, like ethics. After all, if you can&rsquo;t choose your actions, how can you be responsible for them=
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This text is false because it is conflating the two main definitions of free will. It is deterministic that I am going to do what I want, and what I want to do is deterministic since it is determined by my unchangeable DNA and unchangeable past experiences.
</p>

<p>
You did not choose your parents, where you were born, your native language, your early child education or all the external factors that caused your brain to take adopt the personality you call your own. You could have been any of the other humans on earth - and if you were progressed they did - you would have been them. You could have been any of the animals as well, it is just luck of the draw that you are here, now, human, and capable of reading this writing.
</p>

<p>
So, if humans are deterministic, can we hold bad people accountable for their actions?
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you don&rsquo;t give negative feedback for when people do bad, you create an environment where they have no deterrence from doing bad stuff.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s precisely because people don&rsquo;t have free will that we should be held accountable when people understood what they did, to discourage this behavior in the future or serve as an example. If people truly had free will, such environmental factors wouldn&rsquo;t influence them.</li>
<li>But yes, stay humble. When we do good, we are a product of our environment, but we should practice cultivating those good traits and fixing our flawed ones.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s precisely because people don&rsquo;t have free will that they can be persuaded.</li>
<li>Free will is the most powerful illusion created by the brain to keep the conscious part sane and acting in the desired direction (people who believe in free will accomplish more and people who feel in control have better immune systems and energy etc.)</li>
<li>You correctly pointed out the fact that no one becomes atheist, altruistic, transhumanist of their own free will. We were just lucky/unlucky enough (depending on how you look at it) to come to the conclusions we&rsquo;ve come to.</li>
</ul>
<p>
If people truly had free will, environmental factors wouldn&rsquo;t influence them.

<h2 id="epistemology"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Begin Of Criticisms Of Epistemology Section</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-epistemology">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Science is a result of our ability to reason, it can never explain reason itself.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This can be proven false if one day science IS able to explain how the capacity to reason is generated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Studying philosophy by the means of physics is just as wrong. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is true that philosophy requires far, far more than just physics in order to be properly understood. However, there is no reason why a rational understanding of physics can&rsquo;t be harmonious and cooperative with a rational understanding of philosophy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>BAD ARGUMENT: Just because we can&rsquo;t weigh or put consciousness in a test tube doesn&rsquo;t mean it doesn&rsquo;t exist. Even if someday we could scientifically explain consciousness or even create a robot with consciousness, it doesn&rsquo;t change the meaning of it. Consciousness is the faculty to perceive existence, and ironically, if you try to prove that consciousness doesn&rsquo;t exist, you&rsquo;ve just shown that it does.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>These statements are true, but they disprove claims made by only <b>a small minority</b> of materialists, however it is perfectly possible to believe in materialism and agree that consciousness does exist as a unique phenomenon that must be studied differently from the rest of the universe. It is not an error to understand that the human brain is composed of physical substances.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>BAD ARGUMENT: Since sense perception is the only means that we have to observe reality, and reality (as it is examined) is proven to be objective, anything observed through sense perception is objective.</li>
<li>BAD ARGUMENT: Therefore, sense perception is an objective (true) way of viewing the world that can <b>only</b> deliver objective information, so it is valid.</li>
<li>BAD ARGUMENT: Another way to prove the accuracy of sense perception: The validity of sense perception is necessary to examine the rest of philosophy, so there are two options: we either live in a world where the senses are valid and the rest of philosophy is worth discovering, or we live in a world where the senses are invalid and the rest of the philosophy is not worth discovering.</li>
<li>BAD ARGUMENT: Clearly, the rest of philosophy IS worth discovering, so according to the Principle of Non-Contradiction, sense perception HAS TO be valid.</li>
<li>BAD ARGUMENT: The purpose of our senses is to give us objective information about the world around us so that we can grasp reality, and in that regard they are infallible. It is only in the conceptual realm that we are capable of errors. Even if the senses are impaired or missing, they are still valid because everybody is still perceiving the same reality. Errors can only occur on the conceptual level.</li>
<li>BAD ARGUMENT: Determinism fails in philosophy since it assumes that people cannot be held accountable for their actions.</li>
<li>FALSE: A concept is the mental integration of two or more units which are isolated by a process of abstraction and united by a specific definition.</li>
<li>FALSE: Logic is a result of, and obeys the Law of Identity.</li>
<li>NOT QUITE: Although emotions are beyond our direct control, we can still control them indirectly through the choices, concepts, and thoughts we have made in the past.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some emotions are even beyond direct control, specifically because it was evolutionarily beneficial to our ancestors for emotions to be that way. For example, someone may love a former partner of theirs for many many years after they broke up with each other, even though they may wish that they could just stop loving their ex-lover.</li>
<li>Not only that, but since the universe is fundamentally deterministic, so are our feelings, actions, and behaviors. When the determinism of the universe flows through us, we can control our emotions to an extent, but is misleading to believe that this would give us total indirect control over our emotions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NOT NECESSARILY (BECAUSE REASON CAN BE WRONG AND IS ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON SENSE PERCEPTION AND ONE&rsquo;S EXPERIENCES): Reason is the means by which ideas are validated according to reality.</li>
<li>NOT QUITE, TWO THINGS TO NIT-PICK HERE: Since reality is objective and reason is the only means of cognition that is grounded in reality, reason is thus the only form of objective knowledge.</li>
<li>FALSE, THIS IS OBSERVABLY NOT TRUE FOR MANY PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE ARBITRARY IDEAS: Holding arbitrary ideas is worse than holding false ideas, because the mind has completely obliterated any means of objectively identifying ideas in reality, and it has abandoned the mechanism to correct any errors. By definition, the supernatural is not something that we can identify.</li>
<li>FALSE, THEY CAN BE ARGUED WITH RATIONALLY, BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THE BELIEVER WILL LET GO OF THE ARBITRARY BELIEFS: Arbitrary statements cannot be argued with rationally.</li>
<li>BAD ARGUMENT: To prove that a supernatural concept doesn&rsquo;t exist is impossible because in order to determine something is true or false you need to use reason, and reason rests upon identifying things in reality (and yet non-existent ideas cannot be identified in reality). It is unfalsifiable. Proving a negative is cognitively impossible, because it involves identifying something that doesn&rsquo;t exist (impossible) and then proving it doesn&rsquo;t exist (impossible).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is perfectly possible and feasible to prove that supernatural concepts don&rsquo;t exist if they break the law of non-contradiction. Did Ayn Rand or the author never learn how to do propositional logic, or the inference rule of Negation Introduction?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FALSE: Although it is true that we cannot disprove the existence of God, this utilizes the Absolute Certainty Fallacy, which is a logical fallacy and Russel&rsquo;s Teapot analogy, which says that we can&rsquo;t prove that&#x2026;</li>
<li>FALSE: One can&rsquo;t violate all the laws of knowledge, assert an arbitrary statement not based in reality, then ask someone to obey the proper laws of knowledge to prove the statement wrong!</li>
<li>FALSE: Reducing life down to a collection of organized atoms ignores a vast amount of observations that show the living act in a fundamentally different way than the dead.</li>

<h2 id="ethics"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Begin Of Criticisms Of Ethics Section</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-ethics">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>THIS IS AN EXTREMELY BAD AND PARTISAN DESCRIPTION OF THE PERSON WHO FOUNDED MODERN PHILOSOPHICAL THOUGHT, IT DOESN&rsquo;T EVEN QUOTE KANT HIMSELF: Essentially what Immanuel Kant did was to remove reason from ethics, and to hold ethics above reason since altruism had to have a mystical base in order to exist, and in order to save the morality of altruism he had to secularize it. Under the Kantian view of ethics, the highest form of morality is to be selfless. To be moral, one must act out of a sense of &ldquo;duty&rdquo;, and gain no benefit from their actions. The more one acts without benefiting themselves, the more moral they become.</li>
<li>THIS IS AN EXTREMELY BAD AND PARTISAN DESCRIPTION OF EXISTENTIALISM: Existentialists view the consciousness of each individual as the creator of its own reality, and thus ethics should be up to the individual, who should be guided by their own arbitrary feelings. In other words, things like good and evil are subjective, and based only on the perceptions and feelings of each person. This is invalid because it advocates the &ldquo;primacy of consciousness&rdquo; (one must determine the concepts of good and evil before they can exist) It can conjure a wide range of ethics, from those who advocate &ldquo;living in the moment&rdquo; and doing &ldquo;what feels good&rdquo;, to &ldquo;screw you, every man for himself!&rdquo;, to &ldquo;being one with nature&rdquo;, to &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all interconnected and should live for one another&rdquo;. Ethics should not be left to subjective, personal whims.</li>
<li>FALSE: The most important values all ultimately originate because we have the possibility of dying (they constitute the lowest physiological level of Maslow&rsquo;s Hierarchy of Needs).</li>
<li>QUOTE TO USE FOR DESCRIBING IMMORTAL ROBOT THOUGHT EXPERIMENT BEFORE EXPLAINING WHY THERE&rsquo;S A SIMPLER AND BETTER THOUGHT EXPERIMENT AVAILABLE: &ldquo;To make this point fully clear, try to imagine an immortal, indestructible robot, an entity which moves and acts, but which cannot be affected by anything, which cannot be changed in any respect, which cannot be damaged, injured or destroyed. Such an entity would not be able to have any values; it would have nothing to gain or to lose; it could not regard anything as for or against it, as serving or threatening its welfare, as fulfilling or frustrating its interests. It could have no interests and no goals&rdquo; (The Virtue of Selfishness, p. 15).</li>
<li>THEORETICALLY, HUMANS COULD STILL HAVE SOME VALUES EVEN IF THE IMMORTAL ROBOT EXPERIENCE WAS MADE A REALITY</li>
<li>I would argue that although the Immortal Robot does prove that some of humanity&rsquo;s most important values would be eliminated if humans assumed immortality, it probably wouldn&rsquo;t be true that immortal humans would have absolutely no values at all since they would still have emotions and be able to enjoy creativity and aesthetics (visually, audibly, odorously, gustatiously, and other sensational experiences).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Art and esthetics are a result of holding certain values and the emotion that comes with them.</li>
<li>Creativity would give us the goal of creating new things.</li>
<li>Aesthetics would give us the goal of experiencing pleasurable sensations.</li>
<li>Such things could then be considered values since there would the alternative of not creating or experiencing them.</li>
<li>Humans would work to gain and keep them, thus giving meaning to an immortal, indestructible existence.</li>
<li>Emotions and friends would also be possible since they both require values to exist.</li>
<li>Immortal beings would have life, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be a value to them because there would be no alternative to them. If an immortal being does have values, then they would only be possible due to creativity and aesthetics. If the being is too primitive to experience either of these qualities however, then their existence would be meaningless. For all mortal humans, life is the ultimate value because it makes all the other values possible to pursue. With no life, no other values could exist.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rand&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;evil&rdquo; is not a good definition (and her conception of good and evil are still arbitrary since they assume that life is good): Every action we take is consequential to our lives, and either good or evil (for life or against it).</li>
<li>NOT NECESSARILY: The ten most important virtues are life, rationality, the pursuit of happiness, self-esteem, independence, integrity, honesty, justice, productiveness, and pride.</li>
<li>FALSE: The primary vice is irrationality. It is the root of all evil and the originator from which all other vices are derived from.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Even if we assume that objective morality exists, &ldquo;evil&rdquo; is very poorly defined. Would a crocodile or other carnivorous predator eating a human being be considered evil, even though the person who&rsquo;s getting eaten may be perfectly rational? Rand completely fails to acknowledge that life competes against other life, and when it&rsquo;s human versus human (often necessarily so in the case of scarce resources and no viable solutions to the Tragedy of Commons), morality is undoubtedly subjective.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FALSE: Being pragmatic is not rational; it&rsquo;s thinking and acting short term, and ignoring the long-term consequences. Being pragmatic will generally result in losing self-esteem and a lack of true happiness, which are fundamental goals in our lives.</li>
<li>FALSE: Government initiated force through taxes and regulations is also force. Although there are a million well thought-out justifications for government initiating force on its citizens, one thing they all have in common is that they all desperately try to evade the contradiction of violating the principle that initiating force is wrong.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Land Rent may be enforced as Land Value Tax, but it would still be justified by proper libertarian ethics and a true defense of all negative rights since the goal is to protect the negative equal right to land.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
FALLACIOUS ARGUMENT: The good must see morality in black and white, while the evil will try to turn everything into shades of gray, as it must. Most people don&rsquo;t want to do something that is clearly evil, so it happens gradually.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>[my explanation why it&rsquo;s a bad idea to see morality as black and white; also, nothing is objectively immoral, so this is a bad argument since it relies on a false premise]</li>
<li>FALSE: No one is evil all the time; to practice evil consistently would mean the destruction of your life. Evil wants to destroy, but it first must have something to destroy.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is only true if &ldquo;evil&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;anti-life&rdquo;. Also, &ldquo;evil&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t necessarily destroy life because it nothing is objectively evil. In fact, sometimes doing &ldquo;evil&rdquo; things is necessary in order to survive (stealing food, fighting for scarce resources under a tragedy of the commons, etc).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FALSE: Rationalizing is NOT the same as using reason. Since getting the consciousness to avoid reality is ultimately not possible, it works to destroy the person.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Everybody will rationalize their existence to some extent since they are evolutionary programmed to justify their own existence, survival, and values, even if they&rsquo;re values are irrational and their existence is counter-productive to establishing human civilization, which is built upon mutual cooperation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Government usually doesn&rsquo;t rapidly erode freedoms, it takes it piece by piece. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for the greater good&rdquo;, or &ldquo;to protect our security&rdquo;, or &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just temporary&rdquo;.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>True but a government should still do whatever is reasonably necessary to establish human civilization by avoiding prisoner&rsquo;s dilemmas and tragedies of the commons. And this includes many limitations on individual freedom that would&rsquo;ve been seen as evil by Ayn Rand, even though they&rsquo;re rational, like: Universal LVT, limits on reproductory rights (to avoid population before it ever hits the carrying capacity of the environment), necessary urban planning regulations, environmental regulations for protecting everyone&rsquo;s land rights (which avoids a tragedy of the commons), enforcing traffic laws and driver&rsquo;s licenses, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FALSE: Humans can&rsquo;t survive by adapting to nature. They must adapt nature to them.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It depends on whether you believe humans should use advanced technology to avoid evolutionary mismatch, or should live as their primitive ancestors did for evolutionary and anti-technology reasons.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>BAD ARGUMENT: The threat of force eliminates the ability to think rationally. One is forced to act against their own judgment and against what they believe is right. Since force paralyzes the mind from functioning properly, it is unable to use reason, and thus impotent in the situation, regardless of whether they are a genius or a moron. If one&rsquo;s mind is paralyzed, so are their actions (because the mind and body are inseparable). One is forced to act against their own judgment, so they are forced to be irrational. The immorality of initiating force also applies if the force is credible but not direct at the moment. Mafia capos, violent government agents, tax collectors, and other figures that operate under the threat of force also paralyze the victim&rsquo;s ability to reason, sending the individual into a fight or flight response. The reality is that man&rsquo;s mind does not, and cannot, function at the point of a gun, no matter if the gun is two inches from their face, or cleverly hidden from view.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is bad reasoning. Obviously it depends on the context, but there are still plenty of situations where force is being imposed on a person or persons, and the person(s) are still able to think rationally (e.g. two armies fighting at war with each other, while the generals make rational, strategic plans about how to defeat the other army).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>BAD ARGUMENT: It is also a lose-lose situation for the forceful aggressor because obtaining value through the use of force is inherently antithetical to the pursuit of happiness and self-esteem.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>i</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The principle that initiating force is wrong is generally accepted, but probably the most evaded principle in society today, as it has been throughout history.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>True, but often if one wishes to survive within a world full of unresolved prisoner&rsquo;s dilemmas, tragedies of the commons, and more losers than winners, sometimes there is no other choice but to use force as one must to survive.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To a truly independent person, the thought of ruling or having power over others is revolting, and they do not seek it, except what may be required for a certain job.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>While I can see where she&rsquo;s coming from whe she says this, it&rsquo;s not necessarily true.</li>

<h2 id="political-philosophy"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Begin Of Criticisms Of Political Philosophy Section</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-political-philosophy">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>FALSE: Rights are inalienable, meaning they exist because of our human nature and can&rsquo;t be severed from any rational being. They cannot be taken away, only infringed upon.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The rationale for this assertion has not been explained clearly enough. On what basis did you decide that everyone should have rights and why? For example, why shouldn&rsquo;t be ethical to euthanize an infant at a young age if they are destined to only be a net burden to society and are unlikely to enjoy life?</li>
<li>Also, why is this libertarian political theory in favor of &ldquo;parental rights&rdquo;, but very strongly against freedom for children? Why should parents have the right to indoctrinate children into believing false religions that violate the principle of explaining how before why? Although this political theory insists that everybody has rights, insisting upon &ldquo;parental rights&rdquo; gives parents way too much authority over their children, which in turn denies the children of reasonable negative rights (which are necessary due to the nature of how knowledge is formed, especially for children who haven&rsquo;t had the time or experience to acquire much knowledge to begin with). When it comes to the nature of parent-child relationships, somewhere you have to draw the line between the rights and freedoms of the parents versus the children, however those may be defined.</li>
<li>Also, insisting that everybody should be free to have as many children as they want, as it currently is now, will eventually lead to the decline of human civilization as the dysgenics progresses due to the conditions of modernity.</li>
<li>This is kind of pedantic, but rights <b>should</b> be taken away from someone if they break the rules of the society they live in.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FALSE: Since rights are inalienable, they cannot be granted by anyone, including government. They can only be recognized.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Maybe some moral perspectives might consider their respective moral rights to be inalienable, legal rights absolutely are and should be granted by the government since it is the government&rsquo;s duty to resolve prisoner&rsquo;s dilemmas and tragedies of the commons.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>BAD ARGUMENT: The idea that government grants rights is nonsensical. It would mean that anything could be considered a right and any right could be taken away by decree.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rights are formulated according to moral perspectives, so it is already the case that anything can be considered a right, and any legal right can taken away by decree if the legal entity decides to do so.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FALSE: The only rational way to approach rights is to view them as objective moral principles, and government as a means to protect them.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Objective morality doesn&rsquo;t exist, and you cannot apply form ethics based on morality since it is impossible to apply objective reasoning to subjective morality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FALSE: In order to have rights, one must be capable of understanding what rights are and respecting others&rsquo; rights. Thus, criminals that violate the NAP do not have rights and animals do not have rights if they are unable to understand what they are and respect the rights of humans.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If that&rsquo;s the case and this statement is interpreted literally, then many mentally retarded people, mentally incompetent people, and people with advanced dementia would not have any rights.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NOT WELL FORMULATED: All rights are derivatives of the most fundamental right to life. Property is one of them. Since we own our own bodies and minds, we also own the material goods they produce. We have the right to gain, keep, give and dispose of these material values. Having the right to life and liberty, without property, is nonsensical. We need material goods to survive and make our lives better, and much of our thinking and actions are aimed at this goal. It&rsquo;s not real freedom. No entity has any legitimate moral claim to another&rsquo;s property. After all, where would that claim originate from? 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This assertion completely ignores the negative equal right to land and natural resources.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>HAS THE AUTHOR CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATION OF WHAT THEY&rsquo;VE WRITTEN HERE?: When examining the right to free speech, property rights are often forgotten. When one is on someone else&rsquo;s property, they get to set the terms of its use by right. While you can spout of racist epithets or yell &ldquo;fire&rdquo; in your own house all day long, that right disappears when on someone&rsquo;s property, if they don&rsquo;t approve.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This sentence by the author seems to suggest the ethical theory of propertarianism, but if that&rsquo;s what the author is in favor of, then they weren&rsquo;t very explicit that rights should work according to propertarianism.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>REGARDING FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION: In order to discover truth, we must be free to present ideas, both good and bad, and be able to argue. A free society values this, and settles disputes by reason, arguing, protesting, boycotting, or even ignoring.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If this is the rationale for freedom of expression, then the author should be against big tech corporations who abuse their power to manipulate search engine results and censor ideas.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>HAS THE AUTHOR CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATION?: It would be immoral to prevent someone from worshiping any God, but at the same time, a person couldn&rsquo;t morally proclaim their religion required outlawing women from driving, or required involuntary human sacrifice. If it infringes on someone else&rsquo;s rights, it&rsquo;s not freedom of religion.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So if this is the case, then why do parents have the &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; to indoctrinate their children into believing in false, contradictory ideas?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>IGNORING THE EQUAL RIGHT TO LAND AND NATURAL RESOURCES: To assert a material good or service is one&rsquo;s right ends up negating the concept of rights entirely. All material goods require labor to obtain or create.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Land is a material good that is not created by labor, and yet it is completely ignored and not given any attention here.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FALSE: The key is to identify evil, and strive to eliminate it from your life. Evil is like cancer, and having a little bit of evil is like having a little bit of cancer. If you ignore it or try to evade it, it will continue to grow if not fought off, and eventually destroy you.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Objective evil doesn&rsquo;t exist, and this statement reinforces dogma and utopia ideology, libertarianism in this case.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FALSE: Most issues regarding pollution, vaccination, and similar problems could be solved in a voluntary society with contracts that don&rsquo;t violate the NAP, such as landlords, homeowner&rsquo;s associations, and other types of voluntary communities all have the power to set the terms for things like noise, lights, pollution, etc. on private properties.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>But at what point do &ldquo;choices&rdquo; become coercion? In 2021 and 2022, many governments and even corporations started denying their goods, services, and monetary exchanges to people who didn&rsquo;t want to take the risky COVID-19 vaccine.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NOT QUITE: The higher a society&rsquo;s standard of living, the greater importance they&rsquo;ll place on pollution. In this regard, it&rsquo;s a subjective issue that is best left to a society to deal with on a voluntary level, respecting the NAP while using property rights to address.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This is true, however pigouvian taxes on pollution are the most logical way to resolve pollution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>DEMONSTRABLY FALSE: Small Harm For Large &ldquo;Benefit&rdquo;: This is the &ldquo;ends justifies the means&rdquo; mentality, which is irrational and assumes that transferring property from one person to another is a simple matter. If a &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; cannot be accomplished voluntarily in a civilized society, there is never justification for initiating force to achieve it. If someone doesn&rsquo;t want to contribute to a certain cause, it&rsquo;s their right.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Building infrastructure like charging stations for electrical vehicles and such is absolutely the job of the government, and the ends would justify the means since there is often not enough incentive to build the infrastructure, even if it would be economically beneficial. Corporations cannot build the EV charging stations if there isn&rsquo;t enough demand for them, and there will never be enough EVs driving on the road to justify building enough charging stations since the consumer adoption of EVs is strongly dependent on having enough charging stations around.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FALSE: ALL OR NOTHING ATTITUDE TOWARD RISK: This argument says that if there is a risk of harming or damaging other people&rsquo;s lives and property, then it is aggression, and thus immoral. This confuses risk with aggression. There is risk in almost any activity, whether in civilization or alone on a desert island. Morally, there is a profound difference between someone injuring you by accident or on purpose. If you voluntarily live in civilization and take part in activities like driving, you are accepting the risk.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Morality is still subjective. Antinatalists would argue that the risk of children having a bad life means that nobody should be allowed to have children at all, which is consistent with their belief that life shouldn&rsquo;t exist.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NOT QUITE: To fully exercise rights implies that one is a functioning adult, meaning they are fully able to use their rational faculties. We don&rsquo;t recognize a child&rsquo;s right to a firearm, or to sign a contract, and when the elderly cease to have rational faculties, a relative might be granted power of attorney. This should go without saying, but when a parent makes the decision to have a child, they are undertaking the responsibility of sustaining its life until they are able to mentally and physically support themselves. This is a clear result of the choice to procreate. Any significant acts of neglect are in essence violating a child&rsquo;s right to life, and should be dealt with accordingly by a free, moral society.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Parents still don&rsquo;t have the right to indoctrinate children to religions or anything else that violates the Explaining HOW Before WHY Principle.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FALSE: Capitalism has done more to improve the standard of living for both rich and poor alike than anything else, and that is a natural result flowing from its morality.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Yes, Capitalism does greatly improve the human standard of living, but this is not a result of its &ldquo;morality&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a result of effective mutual cooperation, specialization, and more.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FALSE: Unlike animals, there is not a fixed amount of resources available to us. The amount of wealth and prosperity is as endless as the human mind is powerful.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Eventually, humans will run out of at least SOME natural resources. The world has finite fossil fuel supplies, and profit margin of extracting them is decreasing faster than ever, as they are being extracted from the Earth more and more.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FALSE: Any divergence from capitalism means introducing force into society&rsquo;s interactions. The more government controls there are, the more individuals are forbidden to act by right.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There are many valid criticisms against capitalism, like how it disregards the equal right to land and natural resources. [other criticisms against capitalism listed in file]</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NOT QUITE: Obviously, not everyone will act virtuously under capitalism, nor adhere to the virtues of justice. There will still be fraudsters, thieves and crooks, as there are in any society. It&rsquo;s possible these types will still succeed in gaining economic values in a voluntary society, but it will tend to be on the fringes and short term. A business isn&rsquo;t built by defrauding its customers. Liars and hucksters do not achieve long-term success in a voluntary society if they don&rsquo;t offer any values. They tend to be ostracized and condemned.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For example, consider how wealthy countries still buy products from poorer countries that use child labor. Or how food safety is a huge concern in China. These capitalist problems still persist today.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FALSE: Justifications for the state like &ldquo;we the people are the government&rdquo;, &ldquo;social contract&rdquo; theory, and &ldquo;the greater good&rdquo; all fail to hold up to rational examination.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Once again, morality is subjective.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NOT QUITE: Taxation is just another word for theft. Regardless of its intentions, the money is acquired by coercion, the threat of violence against innocent people.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This does not apply for Land, Natural Resources, or Pollution Taxes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FALSE: The typical immediate reaction to stating that &ldquo;individual rights and taxation cannot coexist&rdquo; is normally along the lines of &ldquo;this would never work&rdquo; or &ldquo;that&rsquo;s fantasy&rdquo; or &ldquo;no one would voluntarily pay taxes, everyone would try to freeload&rdquo;, etc. These are all pragmatic objections, not principled ones. If we went back in history, the same pragmatic arguments would be made to support things like slavery. By ignoring morality, strong pragmatic arguments could be (and were) used to justify such systems. &ldquo;Who would do such menial labor? We&rsquo;d all starve!&rdquo; &ldquo;Abolishing slavery would send civilization into chaos&rdquo;. The question of how society would change and function without slavery was largely unknown to the abolitionists. They couldn&rsquo;t have predicted the vast changes (and improvements) that would result from such a change. All they really knew was that the institution was immoral, and wasn&rsquo;t compatible with reason and a free society, thus was untenable. Similarly, it&rsquo;s impossible to predict how society would look and function without coercive taxation, but likely it would result in great improvements, as things do every time a society adopts rational, moral ideas.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This ignores that slavery was only able to be eliminated due to sufficient technological advancement.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>NOT QUITE: A common objection would be that the poor would have lousy services if not subsidized, but one only needs to look at how lousy they get treated now by our current system and how many minorities view the police with contempt, not as protectors. Yet, they still get car insurance and cell phones on par with the more affluent. A voluntary system would mean the police would need to serve, not harass, the population.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Many minorities view the police with contempt due to their false moral and utopian ideologies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FALSE: Wars are extremely costly, and typically don&rsquo;t benefit the citizens of either country. A free, productive people will be more than happy to both fight for and finance protection from a real, aggressive enemy, but will shy away and withdraw funding from a military who&rsquo;s purpose is too broad. A nation that is decentralized, productive and fiercely independent (think Switzerland) is not a very desirable target for other aggressive nations to target.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Once again, Libertarianism is ignorant of geopolitical realities. This statement ignores that Switzerland&rsquo;s geography is what has made it possible for them to defend their country the way they do. The same can be said for how the Taliban eventually defeated the American-backed Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, or how the jungles of Vietnam made the fighting more difficult.</li>
<li>Also, as much as the Tibetans may want freedom and may even be willing to fight in favor of it, the geopolitical reality is that they don&rsquo;t have freedom from China since China knows that it is geopolitically necessary for their self-intersts to occupy Tibetan in order to give China a sufficient buffer against their enemy/rival India, and also to subjugate the countries and peoples of the downstream rivers. The Tibetans don&rsquo;t stand a chance against China due to the massive differences in population and military strength. The same might soon apply to Ukraine and Crimea against Russia (as of January 2022) and maybe even Taiwan if the PRC invades the ROC.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FALSE: Most land on highways and interstates is relatively cheap and barren anyway, but if there were some holdouts in crucial spots, entrepreneurs would have to deal with it by paying more or figuring out an alternate route. The market has a remarkable way of allocating land for its most efficient use, and any landowners who think their land is more valuable than it is will run into the brick wall of economics and the marketplace. If someone doesn&rsquo;t give up trade over their land, it wouldn&rsquo;t be acquired through unethical means like eminent domain.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Land will never truly be allocated towards its most efficient use until universal Land Value Tax is adopted.</li>
<li>Eminent domain would NOT be considered unethical under proper libertarian political theory, which would respect every person&rsquo;s negative equal right to land.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>THIS HAS YET TO BE SHOWN TO WORK: It is also unlikely that roads would become monopolies and force its users to pay exorbitant rates. First, the owner would likely want to maximize profits. If a highway operator raised prices above market levels of supply and demand, they would get less users and revenue than at a market price. At some point, customers would start car-pooling or changing their habits to avoid traveling as much on the road. Roads that were paid for by retail businesses (like in a downtown or mall setting) would want as many people to frequent them as possible, and these would likely be free. If a road operator did start overcharging and raking in huge profits, this would attract new competitors to the market. As long as the market is free, the laws of economics will tend to create the best product at the lowest price. Some argue that in towns or cities there might be only one way in or out, or one &ldquo;Main Street&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s quite rare that there&rsquo;s only one way in or out of a town, but if one entity ended up owning all the streets in a small town, so what? There&rsquo;s often only one gas station, mechanic, pharmacy or baker in a town.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I don&rsquo;t think this can be truly known for sure until it actually plays out in reality. It would be better to observe how such a system actually works in practice, rather than to predict how it would work in theory.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FALSE: In ancient Greece, Athens eventually instituted a voluntary system and was the world&rsquo;s beacon of academic thought for millennia (leaving aside the fact that some, like Plato, desired a state-run institution along with his &ldquo;Philosopher Kings&rdquo;!). Sparta, meanwhile, had a compulsory, state-run system, and took their kids and educated them in barracks to instill state obedience. This yielded a legendary military, but also a totalitarian society that contributed little to the world or to liberty.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Not only is this analysis of this bit of Greek history biased in favor of libertarianism, but it ignores the reality regarding the nature of war and the human competition for natural resources. So Sparta may have been a very powerful militaristic society that managed to conquer all its ancient Greek neighbors, and thus it placed considerably less emphasis on philosophy and learning about the nature of the world. But the text written here ignores that it is precisely because they had such a rigid militaristic society that they managed to survive and thrive for their time.</li>
<li>The neighboring Greek city states that placed less culture and emphasis on military, war, and geopolitical realities got conquered by Sparta, and a more proper way to analyze this snippet of history would be from a Darwinian, sociological, historical, and non-partisan perspective rather than an ideologically libertarian one.</li>
<li>That being said, war may be undesireable, but evolution will select for the human societies that were better at war than their competitors. Even if studying philosophy, the nature of the world, and inventing technology may be a long-term way to avoid the harsh realities of war, disease, and famine that have plagued all of human history, this is not a realistic choice for a society to pursue when the society&rsquo;s neighbors will win out if those neighbors are better prepared for war.</li>
<li>Also, the Romans beating the Carthaginians at war is a very notable example of how a more militaristic civilization defeated and conquered a less militaristic civilization based on free trade. And centuries later, the militaristic civilization was able to have a Golden Age that placed the civilization in the history books and firmly established its influence on all future human civilizations. This contradicts the Grounded Libertarian&rsquo;s claim that it&rsquo;s more lucrative to use &ldquo;peaceful&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-violent&rdquo; methods for furthering human civilization, since the militaristic civilization won and had far greater influence on human civilization, even to this day.</li>
<li>The Romans beating the Carthaginians at war and the rich influence of the militaristic Roman civilization is a good counter example to the grounded libertarian&rsquo;s cherry-picked example of Sparta being a militaristic civilization that contributed nothing to humanity.</li>
<li>Another good example is the rise of Prussia and how it came to dominate and unite all the other German states.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>YES, HOWEVER [SEE BELOW]: Instead of instilling independence, state-run education breeds conformity and obedience.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Virtually all private education would all instill conformity and obedience in children because it would be necessary to teach them. Schools also serve the purpose of teaching children to get along with others, learn social skills, and &#x2026;&#x2026;&#x2026;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>EXTREMELY UNLIKELY AND UNREALISTIC: Parents could render public schools obsolete just by opting out of them. If enough voluntarily move to better options and enrollment dropped, the system would atrophy without firing a political shot. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Literally millions of parents would have to be onboard with this in order for such a plan to work, and it&rsquo;s unlikely that they could all be convinced since most people rarely or even never change their morals or political beliefs. It would also be more expensive for parents who opt out of public education since they would have to double pay for in-person education, unless they use something like Khan Academy. Even then, children&rsquo;s education should have to be advised by an adult who shares the interest of educating the children.</li>
