Note: I have a lot to clarify and re-evaluate in this file since I originally wrote it in late-2020, but have come to disagree with some of what I&rsquo;ve written since I&rsquo;ve changed my mind on the nature and definition of &ldquo;truth&rdquo;.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-self-refutation-intro">
<p>
A performative contradiction arises when the propositional content of a statement contradicts either the act of asserting it or the noncontingent presuppositions that make possible the performance of the speech act, such as occurs with &ldquo;all statements must be false&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
A Performative contradiction, also known as a performative inconsistency or performative self-contradiction, is a type of contradiction that occurs when the speaker&rsquo;s words or actions are inconsistent with their intended meaning or purpose. There are several different types of performative contradictions, including:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Performative-constative contradiction: This occurs when the speaker&rsquo;s statement or action contradicts the content of their statement or action. For example, if a person says &ldquo;I am not a liar,&rdquo; but their actions or statements demonstrate that they are lying.</li>
<li>Performative-epistemic contradiction: This occurs when the speaker&rsquo;s statement or action contradicts the speaker&rsquo;s own knowledge or beliefs. For example, if a person says &ldquo;I know this to be true,&rdquo; but their actions or statements demonstrate that they do not truly believe it to be true.</li>
<li>Performative-deontic contradiction: This occurs when the speaker&rsquo;s statement or action contradicts the speaker&rsquo;s own obligations or rights. For example, if a person says &ldquo;I promise to do this,&rdquo; but they do not follow through on their promise.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Performative-doxastic contradiction: This occurs when the speaker&rsquo;s statement or action contradicts the speaker&rsquo;s own attitudes or beliefs.</li>
<li>Performative-perlocutionary contradiction: This occurs when the speaker&rsquo;s statement or action contradicts the effect that the statement or action is intended to have. For example, if a person says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not angry,&rdquo; but their tone or body language suggests that they are indeed angry.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These types of contradictions can have different effects on the listener or audience and can be used in different ways depending on the context, such as in literature, philosophy, rhetoric, and psychology.
</p>

<p>
Self-refutation refers to the logical fallacy of a statement or argument that contradicts itself. There are several types of self-refutation, including:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Logical self-refutation: This occurs when a statement or argument contradicts its own logical structure. For example, &ldquo;This sentence is false&rdquo; is a classic example of a statement that refutes itself.</li>
<li>Semantic self-refutation: This occurs when a statement or argument contradicts its own meaning. For example, &ldquo;I always lie&rdquo; is a statement that refutes itself because if it is true, then it must be false.</li>
<li>Pragmatic self-refutation: This occurs when a statement or argument contradicts its own implications. For example, &ldquo;You cannot trust anything I say&rdquo; is a statement that refutes itself because if it is true, then it cannot be trusted.</li>
<li>Epistemological self-refutation: This occurs when a statement or argument contradicts its own method of knowledge. For example, &ldquo;All knowledge is uncertain&rdquo; is a statement that refutes itself because if it is true, then it cannot be certain.</li>
<li>Dialectical self-refutation: This occurs when a statement or argument contradicts itself in a dialogue or debate. For example, in a debate, if someone argues that all opinions are equal and then turns around and argues that their own opinion is the correct one, it would be a self-refutation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="performative-contradictions-intro"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> Why Performative Contradictions Are Ideal For Building Our Framework</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-performative-contradictions-intro">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Every performative contradiction has a corresponding theorem, provided that it is a useful one.</li>
<li>Since we wish for our axioms and other assumptions to be as few as possible, we will use all the performative contradictions that we can possibly think of to form what will be called the performative contradiction (PC) theorems.</li>
<li>Theorems that can be proven using regular contradictions (contradictions where a premise does not directly contradict itself by merely uttering it by itself) are less ideal for building the first and second set of theorems for our foundationalist theory since they require more knowledge and pertain to less general concepts.</li>
<li>We have determined that using theorems generated by performative contradictions are very ideal for building a foundationalist theory for several reasons. Once they are established, they can prove (in combination with Classical Logic):
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>They reveal several important theorems that would otherwise be assumed by many philosophers as implicit premises or knowledge that is deemed to be self-evident, which we want to avoid since the revelation of a false implicit premise usually requires rethinking every epistemic conclusion that implicitly assumes that false premise.</li>
<li>Proofs by performative contradiction are formal and rigorous ways for proving statements that many people assume to be self-evident. They therefore constitute a superior proof strategy when it is possible to use them.</li>
<li>Reason is revealed to be a valid source of knowledge.</li>
<li>We have a solid foundation for better understanding the Reasoning Process and basic Reasoning Skills (more commonly known as &ldquo;Critical Thinking Skills&rdquo;).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Even if I did not have this foundationalist framework to prove all the conclusions of the performative contradictions, I would still want to accept all those conclusions anyway based on my own intuition and sense perception. The foundationalist framework helps to further verify those obvious intuitions with a rigor that is higher than intuition.</li>
<li>Note: It is perfectly possible for people to hold self-contradictory beliefs in the Empirically-Grounded Coherentism model of the Understanding of Human Knowledge as long as they don&rsquo;t realize or question the contradiction. Reason is a game that participants must agree to play. Although it might be contradictory to use reason to doubt reason, if people are tempted to doubt reason, they will still do it as long as they haven&rsquo;t realized or refuse to recognize the contradictory in doubting reason. The point here is that even if a belief is self-contradictory, it is up to the believer to realize the contradiction for themselves.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-clarification-of-axiom-system">
<p>
When I initially came up with the idea that I could create the foundation of my philosophy using theorems proven by performative contradictions, I was leaning towards foundationalism since I used to be an Objectivist and Objectivism is a foundationalist philosophy (and <a href="./what-is-objectivism.html">a very contradictory one</a>). At this period in my life, I was still a borderline Efilist, as I didn&rsquo;t have the philosophical understandings to know how to refute Efilism, even though Efilism opposes my biological desires and instincts. On August 2020, I realized why Ayn Rand&rsquo;s and Aristotle&rsquo;s Axioms are contradictory and poorly chosen, which motivated me to come up with this better axiomatic system in an attempt to figure out what the founding assumptions of my philosophy were. You could say that these axioms and theorems are my attempt to <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2016/07/what-is-abyss.html">Immanentize the Abyss</a>, a metaphor for the absence of a foundation for meaning, truth, and value. &ldquo;Abyss&rdquo; means bottomless pit, and the infinite regress of justification is a kind of bottomless pit.
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s be clear: Although I am using axioms to start my philosophy off, the axioms are re-verified by the rest of the philosophy, as we will see in the other webpages that I am writing in this series on  <i>Philosophical Foundations</i> _. Consider the definition of a <b>theory</b>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A theory is a set of sentences which is closed under logical implication. That is, given any subset of sentences {s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>, &#x2026;} in the theory, if sentence r is a logical consequence of {s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>, &#x2026;}, then r must also be in the theory.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Since this blog&rsquo;s philosophy and its axioms all constitute a theory, eventually, the other sentences and propositions of the philosophy will all support each other, so this philosophy is actually coherentist, even though it starts off as being presented as a foundationalist system for pedagogical purposes.

<div id="outline-container-usefulness-of-these-theorems" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="usefulness-of-these-theorems"><span class="section-number-3">3.2.</span> Usefulness Of These Theorems</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-usefulness-of-these-theorems">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Consciousness Theorem proves self-awareness.</li>
<li>The Volition Theorem helps us understand some of the properties of <a href="./free-will.html">Conscious Epistemic Free Will</a>.</li>
<li>The Anti-Skepticism Theorem shows that extreme forms of skepticism are irrational.</li>
<li>The Validity of Reason Theorem works as an additional way to verify reason, and its proof is arguably the simplest way to prove reason&rsquo;s validity.</li>
<li>The Values Theorem comes up when discussing Efilism and Antinatalism.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>At the very least</b>, this simple foundation offers a crude way to get some big questions out of the way and gives us some guidance on figuring out the best philosophical positions to believe in.
As we explore philosophy further and find other ways and reasons to prove and believe in the same things, the performative contradiction theorems will mainly function as an additional way to build coherence within our belief system.

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;There is no truth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This is a valid performative contradiction. Whether truth is subjective or objective, saying this statement contradicts itself.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;(The truth is that) There is no objective truth.&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is <i>not</i> a true performative contradiction since <a href="./1B-truth.html">truth is relative by definition</a>. For that reason, asserting this statement does not have to assume that propositions are objectively true.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-morality-is-not-objective">
<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;There is no objective morality.&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The does not count as a performative contradiction for the same reason why there is no objective truth: morality is intrinsically perspective-dependent. Not only that, but claiming the non-existence of objective morality does not have to implicitly assume the existence of objective morality. Stating that &ldquo;nothing is objectively immoral&rdquo; is merely the statement of an objective fact.
</p>

<p>
It can be more clearly shown why there is no contradiction in this statement if we rephrase the statement with two other statements that have equivalent meaning:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;There is no objective morality.&rdquo; = &ldquo;Nothing is objectively immoral.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing is objectively immoral.&rdquo; = &ldquo;All morality is relative.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hans Herman Hoppe&rsquo;s Argumentation Ethics proposes that it is a performative contradiction to argue against voluntary interaction since that is purportedly assume when engaging with someone during a debate, but this is demonstrably false since debates do not presuppose voluntary interaction (e.g. debating as a defendant in a court of law to be set free and found not guilty).

<h2 id="sense-perception-justification"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> The Justification For Sense Perception</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-sense-perception-justification">
<p>
The justification for sense perception is similar to the justification for reason. Reason is the only thing that we have, so if we reject reason, then we have nothing. Likewise, if we reject empiricism and insist that we cannot trust our senses to the extent that they are not impaired or illusioned, then we don&rsquo;t have any way of receiving any other sort of input from reality.
</p>

<p>
So we don&rsquo;t exactly have a foundation for proving empiricism and sense perception (to the extent that it is valid). We have a brain, and we have senses. And we must choose to use both of them because that&rsquo;s all we have. Fortunately, <a href="./3-understanding-evolution.html#affirmation-of-empiricism">evolutionary reasoning can also justify empiricism</a>, just as it can justify reason, which helps build coherency. It should be self-evident to anybody who rejects the existence of supernatural phenomena that sense perception is the only source of input that humans have for observing and learning about reality.
