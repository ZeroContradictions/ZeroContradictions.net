<h2 id="design-philosophy"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Why This Blog Is Designed The Way It Is</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-design-philosophy">
<p>
This philosophy blog was intended to be structured similarly to the <a href="https://drudgereport.com">Drudge Report</a> and <a href="https://www.philosophybasics.com">PhilosophyBasics.com</a>, but with better and more modern HTML/CSS code.
</p>

<p>
Most blogs tend to organize their posts by the time that the posts were published in reverse chronological order, presumably because people who read the blogs on a regular basis every time a post comes out will presumably have already read most or all of the blog&rsquo;s content. But this blog doesn&rsquo;t do that, and instead the home page categorizes all of the links and posts by category, with short descriptions, so that people who come to this site for the first time will be more likely to read the most important information first. The other reason why I don&rsquo;t organize the posts in reverse chronological order is that I am continuously updating the posts whenever I come up with ideas and I have time to write about them. If I could only publish posts when they were completely finished, then that would greatly reduce the amount of content that I&rsquo;m able to publish. I might eventually come up with a system for marking posts that I deem to be complete and/or create a page for listing the posts in reverse chronological order, but I currently have no plans to do that.
</p>

<p>
One hope of mine is that the blog&rsquo;s homepage could evolve to be a substitute of sorts for what Youtube used to be like, a place for connecting lots of different niche content creators by links that are all in one place. I didn&rsquo;t start using Youtube a lot until 2016, so unfortunately, I actually never got to experience what Youtube used to be like before 2014, but everybody has said that it used to be so much better than it is now.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-creation-of-HTML-and-CSS-pages">
<p>
You can read <a href="../misc/journey.html">my full philosophical and political misc here</a>. When I first started typing down my philosophical thoughts in Vim, I wouldn&rsquo;t have predicted that it would be my first steps towards creating a blog. But the idea of doing such an endeavor did gradually emerge in my mind as the typed text that I had saved to my hard drive grew more and more every day, week, and month. I became particularly motivated to start this project when I saw other philosophy blogs and websites like <a href="http://www.justopia.org/">Justopia.org</a>, <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/">The Wayward Axolotl</a>, <a href="https://www.philosophybasics.com/">Philosophy Basics</a>, and others, so I got the ball rolling with Emacs and made it happen.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I have been typing down my philosophical beliefs for the last 4 years prior to creating this blog, all in plain text. I started off typing them in Vim, but a year later, I switched to <a href="../misc/emacs-and-keyboard-setup.html">Emacs</a>, and as such, I learned how to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Org-mode">Org-Mode</a>, and I started converting all my old philosophy .txt files into .org mode files. In my opinion, <a href="https://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only/">org-mode is the best markup language there is</a>.</li>
<li>Once my files were written in Org-Mode Markup Language, I could use Emacs to export the .org files into .html files, and those are what get displayed on this blog.</li>
<li>I created the homepage&rsquo;s .html file by using this template that I found at joshcanhelp.com: <a href="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/the-drudge-report-style-3-column-link-page-template/">JoshCanHelp Drudge Report HTML Template</a>. I customized it with my own style and formatting, and replaced all the old HTML4 code with HTML5 code.</li>
<li>I created the CSS page by taking the code embedded inside the .html template that I found, placing it in a separate .css file, and modifying it. I wanted to enhance the CSS file, so I learned how to read and write CSS from this Wikibooks link: <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">Wikibooks: Cascading Style Sheets</a>, and every time I had a CSS question that wasn&rsquo;t answered by Wikibooks, I googled it. W3 Schools, GeeksForGeeks, MDN Web Docs, and StackExchange were the most helpful sites. My Firefox CSS Viewer browser extension also helped me out.</li>
<li>I finished the copy-editing on all my .org files to make the HTML output of what I had written readable and presentable.</li>
<li>I chose github.io to host this site, since it&rsquo;s capable of hosting raw .html pages.</li>
<li>I learned how to use Git.</li>
<li>I published this site.</li>
</ol>
<p>
If the .org files contain content that I don&rsquo;t want to publish just yet, I can temporarily comment that stuff out before exporting the .org files to .html. This makes the organization of all my files much easier since I can keep what I&rsquo;m publishing and what I&rsquo;m not publishing all in the same place. I also use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeFileSync">FreeFileSync</a> to further improve my organization since it makes it possible to separate my brainstorming directories from my GitHub directories, although using a .gitignore file instead could work just as well.

<div id="outline-container-over-again" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="over-again"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> How I Would&rsquo;ve Done Everything If I Had To Do It All Over Again</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-over-again">
<p>
When I started creating this blog in October 2022, I didn&rsquo;t understand what a static site generator was and I was pretty ignorant about web development. I had heard of Jekyll, but Github Pages was described as <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/">&ldquo;powered by Jekyll behind the scenes&rdquo;</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator">Wikipedia article on static site generators</a> also didn&rsquo;t explain that static site generators were applications that had to be downloaded on to the developer&rsquo;s computer to help automate website building, so I incorrectly believed that I was already using a static site generator when I wasn&rsquo;t.
</p>

<p>
I would&rsquo;ve created my website so differently if I had explored static generators in more depth. If I had to do everything all over again, this is how I would&rsquo;ve done it:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Choose and download a static site generator that has native support for .org files.</li>
<li>Learn how to use the static site generator to create and manage the website files.</li>
<li>Create the homepage with JoshCanHelp .html template, as well as the website header and footer.</li>
<li>Use coolers.io to pick a readable color scheme.</li>
<li>Use the static site generator to generate and setup the sitemap, RSS feeds, web analytics, comments section, etc.</li>
<li>Learn SEO to add better information to the meta tags.</li>
<li>Continue writing, copy-editing, and formatting all the blog posts.</li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-how-I-chose-my-name-and-avatar" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="how-I-chose-my-name-and-avatar"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> How I Chose My Name And Avatar</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-how-I-chose-my-name-and-avatar">
<p>
I spent a couple of hours over several months pondering which name I should choose. I mostly wanted a unique, original screen name that sounded intelligent, but not arrogant (hopefully). It should be unique, so that it&rsquo;s easily recognizable and easier to copyright my work. And it should imply a rationalist, philosophical worldview so that people can look at my name and quickly think &ldquo;Okay, this guy prioritizes rationality and philosophy over dogmatism&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
I also like how it gives people multiple options for addressing me. Most people call me &ldquo;Zero&rdquo;, but people could also call me &ldquo;ZC&rdquo; by abbreviating my name, or they could say my full name if they&rsquo;d like. As a bonus, &ldquo;ZC&rdquo; can even be pronounced [zɛd si] or [zi si] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">IPA</a>), depending on the dialect of English or personal preference. I can even use &ldquo;0Contradictions&rdquo; as my Twitter handle, since they are limited to 15 characters max.
</p>

<p>
As for my profile picture, I wanted a clean, minimalist design. I naturally prefer minimalistic avatars, and I think it also gives the benefit of being easily recognizable, great for logos, and being associated with rationality (in my opinion anyway). I actually didn&rsquo;t create my profile picture myself. I found it online from a deleted reddit post, and since the author was anonymous and had deleted their account, I figured that it&rsquo;s fair game for me to claim it as my own. The emblem and green background are meant to represent the economic ideology known as Georgism, which I talk about in several of the posts and links on my homepage.

<h2 id="quality-vs-quantity"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Quality Versus Quantity</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-quality-vs-quantity">
<p>
For most topics, I really don&rsquo;t understand bloggers who write posts every day. For one thing, I believe that there is probably a <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/01/are-we-running-out-of-ideas.html">finite amount of good ideas out there to discover</a>, due to the physical materialist nature of the Universe (I&rsquo;ll have to write my own post about that sometime). For another thing, it would have to be extremely unusual for someone to observe or brainstorm something really interesting or noteworthy every single day that is worth writing an entire post about, and if someone did write a blog post every day, the average quality of each post would have to be rather low, or perhaps not even worth reading at all since such a high frequency of content production would require espousing fewer good ideas in each post.
</p>

<p>
Not only do I not have the time to write a new post each day, but even if I did, any newcomer who comes across such a blog for the first time would be lost and unsure of where to start reading since hundreds or even thousands of blog posts would accumulate over time, to the point where it would be very difficult to navigate any of the posts and decide which ones would be worth reading.
