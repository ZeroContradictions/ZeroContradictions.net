<p>
I had always thought that I wanted to be a programmer or software engineer ever since I was 14 years old.
When I heard my first explanation of what a computer scientist is and what they do, I immediately thought that that would be the perfect job for me when I became an adult.
But unfortunately, I encountered numerous obstacles in trying to become one, and finally realizing that it&rsquo;s not for me.

<div id="outline-container-high-school" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="high-school"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> High School</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-high-school">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I attended my ninth grade year at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_school">charter high school</a> focused on technology.</li>
<li>I was taught how to write basic HTML and really basic programming concepts with Alice in ninth grade.</li>
<li>In March 2014, my parents bought me a book called <i>Learn C++ in 24 Hours</i>. It is frankly a horrible book for learning how to program compared to all the other books out there. I suppose it was better than nothing, but there are several problems with the book:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is misguiding to make people believe that you they learn an entire programming language in just a single day. But since I was only 14 years old at the time, I didn&rsquo;t know any better.</li>
<li>Most of the supposed benefits that it represents about C++ are vague, and are applicable to all the other programming languages in the C language family.</li>
<li>It didn&rsquo;t teach how to access library functions, which is the bulk of the actual language. No introductory teaching of a programming language can be considered complete if it doesn&rsquo;t even teach how to access library functions.</li>
<li>It wastes time talking about things that don&rsquo;t really improve the quality of programs, like <a href="#OOP-is-overrated">OOP</a>, operator overloading, etc.</li>
<li>The <i>C Programming Language</i> by K&amp;R is a better book for introducing programming. It explains many concepts better than <i>Learn C++ in 24 Hours</i>, including many topics that it doesn&rsquo;t cover at all, like pointer arithmetic, library functions, structures, the UNIX system APIs, etc.</li>
<li>C++ isn&rsquo;t a very good language for teaching programming in general. It&rsquo;s better to learn C before learning C++.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I wrote my first programs on an iPad. And I didn&rsquo;t even have a physical keyboard to type on since my parents couldn&rsquo;t afford to buy me a real computer since we lived paycheck to paycheck.</li>
<li>Since the iPad didn&rsquo;t have any software that could run a C++ compiler on it, I used an online C++ compiler as a work-around since that could run in the Safari web browser on the iPad. That was the only way that I could find for compiling code on a device that was never made for programming to begin with. Sometimes the work that I typed into the online compiler didn&rsquo;t get saved, but sometimes it did save the code as web browser cookies. I only typed short programs due to the limitations I had.</li>
<li>When my grandmother gave my parents the money to buy me a computer, I didn&rsquo;t even get the computer that I wanted because my father insisted on buying a 15&ldquo; mid-2012 MacBook Pro, when I wanted a computer that ran Linux instead. It had great specs for being a first computer, but it still wasn&rsquo;t what I wanted. In hindsight, I was right that this held me back:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It prevented me from getting an environment that was easier to tinker around with.</li>
<li>I was frustrated because I couldn&rsquo;t find any IDEs or text editors for learning how to program that felt comfortable for beginners.</li>
<li>I couldn&rsquo;t follow many Linux tutorials with the MacOS environment.</li>
<li>MacOS is a less comfortable desktop environment compared to Xfce (in my opinion anyway).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I willingly switched my keyboard layout from Qwerty to Dvorak, then to Colemak when I was 16 years old, so I learned how to type on a keyboard three times over.</li>
<li>When I first heard of Emacs at 15 years old, I knew that it had a <i>really</i> high learning curve, but I also knew that that was exactly what I wanted to use as my text editor, based on the online testimonies of people who use it.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Unfortunately, I was mislead into believing that I couldn&rsquo;t use Emacs on the keyboard that I had due to a phenomenon known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs#Emacs_pinky">Emacs Pinky</a>. While this is true to a great extent for vanilla Emacs, this isn&rsquo;t true for Spacemacs, which first came out in 2015.</li>
<li>I was also mislead into believing that I couldn&rsquo;t use Vim because many of the Vim shortcuts are designed for a Qwerty keyboard, and I couldn&rsquo;t figure out a way to map the escape key (&lt;Esc&gt;) closer to my fingers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In tenth grade, I transferred to a better high school. Unfortunately, it didn&rsquo;t offer any programming classes that I could take during tenth grade.</li>
<li>i</li>
</ul>

<p>
From 14-16 years old, I was obsessed with Linux and other OS virtual machines, raspberry pi, desktop environments, but I never really learned as much as I should&rsquo;ve learned with all that time. I didn&rsquo;t know how to learn fast and effectively.
Not to mention that it was impractical to run them.
The raspberry pi was woefully slow, and Ubuntu could never run efficiently on my Macintosh to make it worth using it.
This adds to why I really wish I had been given a Linux laptop to use instead, so I wouldn&rsquo;t have wasted so much time trying to use Linux instead.
</p>


<p>
During this time, I also had a naive, narcissistic phase and an unrealistic worldview, which help me back by so much.
Although I always told myself that I would learn programming and how to become an effective computer scientist on my weekends, I never really did. I had untreated ADHD, so instead I wasted all my time reading stupid polls about the best operating systems and the best programming languages. I really wasn&rsquo;t learning anything.
I slowly overcame my deluded, narcissistic worldview in my junior and senior years as I became more interested in linguistics and politics, instead of my deluded pseudo-progress on learning actual computer science.
I could&rsquo;ve saved myself so much time if I had been introduced to philosophy at an earlier age, and pondered its implications for how I should live my life and organize my theory of value.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>i</li>
<li>Before my junior and senior years, I tried to get into electives that would teach programming, but my high school only offered one class taught any programming.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Unfortunately, I couldn&rsquo;t take the prerequisite courses for that course, since I spent ninth grade in a different school and had to catch up on the new school&rsquo;s graduation requirements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In general, I&rsquo;m sad that I wasn&rsquo;t able to get any of the electives that I really wanted during high school. The electives that I did take during high school were mostly a waste of time.</li>
<li>If I could go back, I wish I had studied Mandarin as a second foreign language, but none of the staff in my high school told me that I could study a second foreign language with my elective courses if I wanted to.</li>
</ul>

<p>
College was a huge game-changer for me.
New content and new assignments were being thrown at me so fast, and I was learning more efficiently than ever before.
This speed at which I was being taught and forced to learn made me realize just how ineffectively I used my time during my teen years.
The new content that I learned (that had been inaccessible and unknown to me in prior years) opened my eyes to realizing just how much knowledge there is out and what kinds of things there are to learn.

Majoring in CS was too hard for me, so I graduated college with a bachelor&rsquo;s in mathematics instead.

<p>
At the start of the summer of 2019, I had a really bad feud between me and my parents.
I couldn&rsquo;t stay at their house, so I signed up for summer classes so that I would&rsquo;ve qualified for on-campus housing at my university.
I really wasn&rsquo;t ready for the last computer science course that I took, and so I failed it.
My time that summer would&rsquo;ve been much, much better spent if I had been trying to switch from MacOS to Linux, switch from Vim to Emacs, and doing what I can to hone my programming skills and make sure that I would&rsquo;ve been ready for the last CS course for completing the CS minor.
</p>


<p>
I had to spend virtually all of my summer of 2020 (3 months) cleaning up my parents&rsquo; messy house.
It hadn&rsquo;t been cleaned in literally a decade, but it was kind of a good thing that I did, lest it would&rsquo;ve been harder to move my terminally-ill grandfather who had stage IV cancer into my parents&rsquo; house.
</p>


<p>
I took a course on C in college, and I almost finished a CS minor, but I didn&rsquo;t pass the last course (data structures) because I didn&rsquo;t complete enough of the assignments to pass.

When I became 24 years old, it occurred to me that I probably didn&rsquo;t want to do programming or software development for a living anymore.
I hadn&rsquo;t realized this until 10 years after I first thought that I wanted to program for a living.
</p>



<p>
Although my father likes computers, and he can program for a while and knows some computer science, he never continue programming simply because it is not one of his major interest.
And it was only now at 24 years old.
I am starting to realize that I am the same way I can do really technical stuff with computers that most people when I have the interested to do and would normally give up on at some point, but I continue doing it anyway because I like it and I like the benefits that came from it, but unfortunately, nevertheless, I just can’t enjoy programming nearly as much as I would enjoy doing mathematics for a living.

<li>2015: I discover BG&rsquo;s blog and youtube channel (or maybe the GroundedLibertarian.com), start thinking about philosophy, and write my thoughts down with Emacs into .org files.</li>
<li>2015: I complete the Duolingo Esperanto tree, discover the Indo-European language family, and read an introductory book on linguistics, perhaps from the local library. I don&rsquo;t waste a hundred hours creating a useless conlang.</li>
<li>2015: I complete Remembering the Hanzi or Remembering the Kanji, before learning how Mandarin or Japanese. I also spend my high school electives learning Mandarin, so that I could be learning two languages during high school.</li>
<li>2015: I learn about neurodivergence, and I get formally/officially diagnosed with Autism and ADHD, and I am prescribed a medication to help with my ADHD.</li>
