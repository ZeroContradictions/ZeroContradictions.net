<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-website-design-philosophy">
<p>
When it comes to media, I&rsquo;ve always preferred a minimalist, mostly text-based design, similar to the kind preached by the <a href="https://1mb.club/about">1MB Club</a>.
Flashy image-loaded designs can&rsquo;t communicate as much distilled, easy-to-digest information, and they also require extra web development and longer loading times.
It took a lot of work to figure out how to design this website the way I did, so I wanted to document how I did everything.
Hopefully this will help other people.
</p>

<p>
This website&rsquo;s homepage is intended to be organized similarly to the <a href="https://drudgereport.com">Drudge Report</a> and <a href="https://www.philosophybasics.com">PhilosophyBasics.com</a>, but with better and more modern HTML/CSS code.
The homepage&rsquo;s .html file was created by using <a href="https://www.joshcanhelp.com/the-drudge-report-style-3-column-link-page-template/">this template that I found at joshcanhelp.com</a>.
I replaced all the old HTML4 code with HTML5 code, and customized it with my own style, formatting, and content.
</p>

<p>
Most blogs organize their posts by the date that the posts were published in reverse chronological order, presumably because the people who habitually read the blogs every time a new post comes out will have already read most or all of the blog&rsquo;s content.
But this blog doesn&rsquo;t do that. Instead, the home page organizes all the links and posts into categories, with short descriptions, so that people who come to this site for the first time will be more likely to read the most important information first.
The other reason why I don&rsquo;t organize the posts in reverse chronological order is that I am continuously updating the posts whenever I come up with new ideas and I have time to write about them.
If I could only publish posts when they were completely &ldquo;finished&rdquo;, then I have would have very little content available for publishing.
In the future, I might create a tagging system that marks the relevant topics within each post and whether they&rsquo;re &ldquo;complete&rdquo; or not, and/or create a page for listing the posts in reverse chronological order, but I currently have no plans to do that.

<h3 id="writing-advice"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> Advice For Writing Content</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-writing-advice">
<p>
It can be tempting to immediately start writing content that you&rsquo;ve been eagerly waiting to write (as I had done), but you will save time in the long run if you hold off from that and spend a few minutes to read and learn how to utilize good writing advice.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Every post should have a meaningful topic. It&rsquo;s also helpful if everyone else writing about the topic is missing a key point or over-complicating simple things.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s important to plan and outline your content <i>before</i> writing it. Many bloggers just write whatever comes off the top of their heads, which their posts to lack structure and organization. I was guilty of this myself for some of my essays, until I restructured them.</li>
<li>Many people have a tendency to write long sentences with <a href="https://www.grammarbank.com/cohesive-devices.html">cohesive devices</a> that place restrictions on how they write their sentences. For such people (including my former self), I recommend taking <a href="https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html">Scott Adam&rsquo;s Writing Advice</a> to heart. Writing shorter sentences is an important key for writing better, especially if the goal is to create information dense content with little fluff. <a href="https://www.elevenwriting.com/blog/fluff-writing">Fluff writing</a> makes content longer to read, harder to understand, and it may bore the readers.</li>
<li>If you need to list a bunch of short ideas, reasons, or arguments in a section, it&rsquo;s a good idea to use bulleted or numbered lists. Paragraphs require adding more cohesive devices and other fluff language compared to lists. As an example, some sections in my <a href="../FAQs/overpopulation-FAQs#effects-on-society">Overpopulation FAQs</a> became more concise and easier to read when written as lists rather than paragraphs.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_quotation_elements.asp">HTML Quotation Elements</a> are a great way to quickly state opposing points of view before addressing them. I&rsquo;ve made my <a href="../civilization/case-against-libertarianism">Case Against Libertarianism essay</a> and other works less wordy by using them.</li>
<li>Lastly, taking at least an hour to learn <a href="#search-engine-optimization">good SEO practices</a> can save you the trouble of rewriting your content later on, if you want to maximize your number of readers.</li>

<h3 id="quality-vs-quantity"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> Quality Versus Quantity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-quality-vs-quantity">
<p>
For most topics, I don&rsquo;t understand bloggers who write posts <i>every day</i>.
For one thing, there&rsquo;s probably a <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/01/are-we-running-out-of-ideas.html">finite amount of good ideas out there to discover</a>, due to the physical materialist nature of the Universe.
For another thing, it&rsquo;s unusual for someone to observe or brainstorm something really interesting or noteworthy every single day that is worth writing an entire post about.
Even if someone did write a blog post every day, the average quality of each post would have to be quite low since such a high frequency of content production would require espousing fewer good ideas in each post.
</p>

<p>
I don&rsquo;t have the time to write a new post each day, but even if I did, eventually hundreds or even thousands of blog posts would accumulate over time.
If a newcomer came across such a blog for the first time, they would be lost and unsure of where to start reading since it would be difficult to navigate and determine which posts are worth reading.

<div id="outline-container-static-site-generators" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="static-site-generators"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> Static Site Generators</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-static-site-generators">
<p>
Most people who want to start blogging and aren&rsquo;t using a Content Management System like Wordpress or Blogger should consider downloading and using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator">static site generator</a> (SSG).
In my opinion, the main benefit to using SSGs is that they make it possible to use Markdown (or Org-Mode) instead of HTML to create webpages, but <a href="https://pagedart.com/blog/what-is-a-static-site-generator/">they also provide many other benefits</a>.
</p>

<p>
Org-Mode wasn&rsquo;t specifically designed to be a static site generator, but one can configure it to do many of the key features that a SSG can do.
<a href="https://taingram.org/blog/org-mode-blog.html">Thomas Ingram</a> and <a href="https://ogbe.net/blog/blogging_with_org">Dennis Ogbe</a> have written their own guides on how to use org-mode as a static site generator for websites.
Their tutorials are more complex than mine, and their resulting websites have more features (e.g. sitemap and RSS feed generators, blogging templates, more detailed headers and footers, etc).
There are also other <a href="https://meganrenae21.github.io/Meg-in-Progress/posts/blogging-with-org-mode">guides that show how to set up tagging systems</a> for posts.
However, I&rsquo;m not experienced enough with Elisp and my website may not need those features, so some people may prefer my simpler tutorial here.
</p>

<p>
Since I already knew how to export my .org files to HTML webpages, I never used a different SSG when I created this website, and I still don&rsquo;t.
The reasons are complicated, but I encountered multiple problems when I last tried to switch to using a more full-fledged SSG in July 2023:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It would take too much time for me to learn how SSGs work, how to configure them, and how to use them. I already have a system for creating and publishing my webpages that works me.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d have to program Emacs keybindings for operating the SSG, lest I would have to use my command terminal to operate the SSG instead, which is inconvenient because then I&rsquo;d have to frequently switch between applications. This would be hard because I&rsquo;m terrible at Elisp (and programming in general).</li>
<li>Most static site generators use Markdown instead of Org-Mode. Although Hugo is compatible with org-mode, there weren&rsquo;t enough tutorials and documentation for showing how to use Hugo with org-mode when I tried to switch over. It&rsquo;s possible that Hugo may develop better documentation for writing with org-mode in the future.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Hypothetically, I could switch to using Markdown to write my webpages, but that would take time, it could create confusion and syntax errors if I switch, and most importantly, I&rsquo;d lose the ability to export my .org content to other formats, like .tex, .pdf, .txt, .odt, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
There are still some benefits for creating and publishing content that SSGs would provide compared to my current system:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>SSGs could provide my website with better headers and footers.</li>
<li>SSGs provide tags for sorting webpages, which makes them easier to navigate.</li>
<li>SSGs have ways to prevent the website directories from displaying in the URLs.</li>
<li>It would be easier to create RSS feeds.</li>
<li>They provide templates for writing webpages.</li>
<li>They provide text summarizers for writing webpage descriptions and such.</li>
<li>They could create a search index that readers could use to search my website&rsquo;s content. Thus, the search bar on my homepage wouldn&rsquo;t have to use an external search engine like DuckDuckGo.</li>
<li>They can create better image galleries.</li>
<li>There are many other plugins for SSGs that make it easier to create content.</li>
</ul>
<p>
However, even after considering all the benefits that I could potentially gain, I decided that it still wasn&rsquo;t worth it for me to stop using my current setup.
Another thing is that my website doesn&rsquo;t really need some of these features, and I have found other ways to get most of the benefits that other SSGs would provide, which I talk about in this article.

Hopefully, this guide will be detailed enough to show other people how to replicate the design process.
It will assume that that the reader is already familiar with the basics of using Emacs.
If the user has no interest in using org-mode or Emacs, then most of the CSS, SEO, and Recommended Tools sections of this article may still be of interest to the reader.
</p>

<p>
Org-mode variables control how the org-mode markup language will be exported to HTML and other formats.
They can be set either within the file itself as file local variables, or within your <code>.config/doom/config.el</code>, (or ~/.emacs.d/init.el for non-Doom-Emacs users).
For a complete list of variables controlling how org-mode exports files, see the following links from the Org-Mode Manual:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Export-Settings.html">Export Settings</a></li>
<li><a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Export-Settings.html">HTML-Specific Export Settings</a></li>
<li><a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing-options.html">Property Options For Org-Mode File Exports</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
There are multiple reasons to set org variables with <code>config.el</code> instead of within file local variables:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It makes the compilation of your org files less prone to errors, assuming that you export a lot of them.</li>
<li>It ensures that all org files export the same way each time, aside from any customizations using local file org variables.</li>
<li>If you later decide to that you want to change something across <i>all</i> your .org files, it&rsquo;s easier to just edit one file (<code>config.el</code>) instead of editing every single org file.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re only going to export org file variables for one purpose or similar purposes, then you don&rsquo;t have to copy as many local org file variables to each new file to do the same things, and the org files will collectively take up less file space. This also gives the beginnings of the org files a cleaner appearance.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I have the following settings configured for org-mode in my <code>config.el</code>.
The user can learn more about what each variable does by pressing <code>SPC h v</code> in Doom-Emacs, or <code>C-h v</code> in regular Emacs.
</p>
<pre class="example">
(setq org-src-fontify-natively t)
(setq org-hide-emphasis-markers nil) ;; Don't hide the /, *, and _ font formatting characters.
(setq org-startup-folded t)
(setq org-startup-truncated nil)
(setq org-startup-with-inline-images nil)
(setq org-return-follows-link nil)

(setq org-html-doctype "html5")
(setq org-html-html5-fancy t)
(setq org-html-content-class "content")
(setq org-html-container-element "div")
(setq org-html-head-include-scripts nil)
(setq org-html-head-include-default-style nil)
(setq org-html-head-extra "&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"/style.css\"&gt;")
(setq org-html-link-home "/")
(setq org-html-link-up "/")

(setq org-export-with-author t)
(setq org-export-with-email nil)
(setq org-export-with-creator nil)
(setq org-html-metadata-timestamp-format "%Y %B %d, %H:%M")
(setq org-html-postamble t)
(setq org-html-postamble-format
 '(("en" "&lt;p class=\"date\"&gt;Last Modified: %T&lt;/p&gt;\n
          &lt;p class=\"author\"&gt;Author: %a&lt;/p&gt;"
  )))
</pre>

<p>
And the following is the entirety of the org-mode keywords and values that I include at the beginning of every .org file for controlling the HTML code of my webpages:
</p>
<pre class="example">
#+title: The_Webpage_Title_That_Will_Be_Placed_In_Both_&lt;title&gt;_and_&lt;h1&gt;
#+subtitle: The_Webpage_Subtitle_That_Will_Be_Placed_In_&lt;subtitle&gt;
#+author: The Author Name
#+description: The webpage description (up to 160 characters long).
#+html_head: [Javascript code for adding Google Analytics to the webpage]
#+html_head: &lt;meta property="og:url" content="[the canonical URL link for this article]"&gt;
#+html_head: &lt;meta property="og:type" content="article"&gt;
#+html_head: &lt;meta property="og:image" content="[Link to image file]"&gt;
#+options: ^:nil
</pre>
<p>
Org-mode provides two different variables for adding code to the &lt;head&gt; section of HTML files, <code>org-html-head</code> and <code>org-html-head-extra</code>.
They&rsquo;re also written as <code>#+html-head</code> and <code>#+html-head-extra</code>, when used as local file variables written at the beginning of org files.
The reason why there&rsquo;s two different variables is because people will often want to embed a lot of code to &lt;head&gt;.
If there were only one variable for adding code to &lt;head&gt;, someone had assigned a value to <code>org-html-head</code> inside their config.el, and they also tried assigning additional values with <code>#+html-head</code> in their local files, then the values written in the local files would overwrite the values for <code>org-html-head</code> inside their config.el so that they wouldn&rsquo;t display at all.
Fortunately, the two separate HTML head variables can be used strategically to prevent this.
In my config.el, I have:
</p>
<pre class="example">
(setq org-html-head-extra "&lt;link rel~\"stylesheet\" type~\"text/css\" href~\"/style.css\"&gt;")
</pre>
<p>
Meanwhile, my local file org variables add the following HTML &lt;head&gt; code to each file:
</p>
<pre class="example">
#+html_head: [Javascript code for adding Google Analytics to the webpage]
#+html_head: &lt;meta property="og:url" content="[the canonical URL link for this article]"&gt;
#+html_head: &lt;meta property="og:type" content="article"&gt;
#+html_head: &lt;meta property="og:image" content="[Link to image file]"&gt;
</pre>
<p>
These settings ensure that all the content that I want to be added to HTML &lt;head&gt; will get included.
</p>

<p>
Every time I want to re-export the HTML output from my org file to update my webpages, I press <code>SPC m e h h</code> in Doom-Emacs, which executes the command <code>org-export-dispatch</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="advice-for-using-org-mode"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Advice For Using Org-Mode</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-advice-for-using-org-mode">
<p>
When creating links in org-mode, <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing-links.html">there are many options</a> and they depend on what you&rsquo;re linking to.
Since I often want to link to section of my website pages, I always insert the following org syntax under each section heading.
Without the following syntax, the fragment identifiers will change every time the org-mode code is re-exported to .html.
</p>
<pre class="example">
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Name_Of_Fragment_Identifier
:END:
</pre>
<p>
This syntax makes it possible to have consistent fragment identifiers once the webpages are published, and users can find them when clicking on links in each webpage&rsquo;s table of contents, and copying the URL.
</p>

<p>
When writing paragraphs in org-mode, I prefer to place each sentence on a separate line (i.e. every line ends with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline">newline character</a>).
The text will not be displayed as separate paragraphs unless there are at least two newlines between each line.
The advantage to this is that it makes it easier to easier to rearrange the sentences in my paragraphs, easier to merge and/or divide paragraphs, and easier to convert between paragraphs and bulleted lists (compared to keeping all of a paragraph&rsquo;s sentences on just one line).
This style for formatting paragraphs and sentences and the <a href="#writing-advice">recommended minimalist writing advice</a> both compliment each other quite well.
</p>

<p>
If an .org file contains content that I don&rsquo;t want to publish just yet, I can temporarily comment that text out before exporting the .org files to .html.
This facilitates the organization of all my files since I can organize all my ideas by file, without having to publish <i>everything</i> that I write.
</p>

<p>
I don&rsquo;t usually export my org files to LaTeX, but I do so when I want to get my works in PDF format.
When exporting .org files to LaTeX, I include the following line at the beginning of the .org file so that the page margins don&rsquo;t take up so much space in the resulting .pdf file.
</p>
<pre class="example">
#+latex_header: \makeatletter \@ifpackageloaded{geometry}{\geometry{margin=2.5cm}}
{\usepackage[margin=2.5cm]{geometry}} \makeatother

It can be overwhelming to create CSS files from scratch, but online templates can make everything easier.</li>

<h3 id="CSS-for-org-mode"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> CSS For Org-Mode HTML Exports</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-CSS-for-org-mode">
<p>
People who are using org-mode to create webpages can use the <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/CSS-support.html">CSS Support section from the Org-Mode manual</a> to inform them of all the ID attributes and classes that are available for tweaking a webpages&rsquo; CSS, using a separate CSS file.
Alternatively, some users may prefer to use the default org-mode CSS with their files.
If you wish to use it, you must have the following line in you <code>config.el</code>:
</p>
<pre class="example">
(setq org-html-head-include-default-style t)
</pre>
<p>
Or you could set it with an org local variable by placing the following line in their org file:
</p>
<pre class="example">
#+options: html-style:t
</pre>
<p>
However, the default org-mode CSS has a total of 7.0kB, and it will be included into every HTML file that you export where the <code>html-style</code> variable is turned on.
It may also complicate or interfere with your own CSS customizations if you link a separate CSS file to your HTML exports.
My advice is to write your own CSS file, and view the output of the default org-mode CSS and copy the useful parts of it that you want to keep for your own custom CSS file.
</p>

<p>
If you would like to overrule the default CSS alignment of the tables, you can use ‘&lt;r&gt;’, ‘&lt;c&gt;’ or ‘&lt;l&gt;’ in a special table cookies row of the table.
You may also combine alignment and field width like this: ‘&lt;r10&gt;’.

There are lots of webpages and websites out there about how to improve SEO, but in my opinion, none of them are as clear or as detailed as <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs">Google&rsquo;s own SEO Documentation</a>, in most cases.
In hindsight, I wish I had used Google&rsquo;s Developer Documentation as my go-to source for SEO questions.

<li>I use <a href="https://greggman.github.io/servez/">Servez</a> as my localhost software. There are many reasons to view websites on a localhost, instead of visiting the absolute file paths for each HTML file from the file manager:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When creating internal links, you don&rsquo;t have to include &ldquo;.html&rdquo; at the end of every webpage link.</li>
<li>Viewing the website from a local host enables your smartphones and other devices to view what the website looks like, besides just how it looks from the computer that you&rsquo;re developing it on.</li>
<li>The log enables you to see all the different files that most load, in order for you to view each of your respective webpages.</li>
<li>If you can get it to work, you can mount all each of the directories containing your blog posts/essays and data files directly after the website&rsquo;s URL.</li>
<li>Localhost URLs are shorter, which makes them easier to read when the screen width is too small.</li>
<li>Since the localhost URL doesn&rsquo;t contain the name of your home directory anywhere within its URL string, you won&rsquo;t accidentally dox your first name if you accidentally send your local web development URL, instead of the public server&rsquo;s URL.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
