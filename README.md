Hello and welcome to my philosophy website. My name is Zero Contradictions, and this place is a hybrid between a blog for my philosophical writings (highlighted in red) and a compendium of external links to works by different authors that have influenced my own philosophy and/or are worth reading (highlighted in blue) as well as links to videos, channels, or audio recordings (highlighted in green). If you click one of the links in the navigation bar, then the page will scroll down to that section, which will be in one of the three columns.

As per its name, the goal of this website is to create the best philosophy ever with Zero Contradictions, or to at least do my best at that. The Modern World has reached an unprecedented level of insanity due to immense evolutionary mismatch caused by the Industrial Revolution and incoherent moral values, and it is now more important than ever to get the philosophical grounding necessary for solving the problems set before us. It is very difficult to change many people's minds, but that is no reason not to try.

NOTE: As of mid 2023, the vast majority of the red link posts written by myself are unfinished and have sections that need further elaboration, but I'm publishing what I have already written for now for others to read if they'd like. Everything on this website is under copyright, unless specified otherwise. If you want to report any typos or broken links, to ask questions, to give constructive criticism, to suggest some links to add to this home page, or to make a donation, please reach out to me at my contact page.
