<p>
Intelligence is the abstract collection of the capacity for logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, and problem solving. There are many different types of intelligence and specialized esoterical knowledge.
Intelligence Quotient (IQ)
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>IQ is a numerical measurement for comparing one&rsquo;s intelligence against other&rsquo;s. It is predictive of a wide range of life outcomes: academic achievement, income, productivity, acts of crime, etc.</li>
<li>IQ is largely determined by genetics, but it isn&rsquo;t everything. Even if IQ is predictive, it doesn&rsquo;t perfectly predict outcomes.</li>
<li>IQ scores are not objective. Algorithms are not objective and they can have just as many flaws as their creator instills into them, therefore IQ tests can only be accurate to a certain extent, making them no more accurate than someone knowing where they generally stand against the populace.</li>
<li>General IQ: Matters more than Nominal IQ because it is the ability for abstract reasoning, how quickly you can acquire skills and knowledge, and how far they can be advanced.</li>
<li>Nominal IQ: Is the skills and knowledge itself. Reading Books, education, etc can improve Nominal IQ.</li>
</ul>
<p>
IQ doesn&rsquo;t equal intelligence, and that is actually a kind of fallacy, but a lot of people take something like IQ, which is a test, and then they make this cognitive heuristic, i.e. a shortcut where they equate IQ with the more abstract concept of intelligence, which is not quite the same thing.
Intelligence is really problem-solving ability.
An example of something that&rsquo;s not covered by an IQ test is: learning.
There&rsquo;s no time to test your ability to learn new things on an IQ test.
</p>

<p>
The argument that IQ tests are culturally biased only applies to Nominal IQ, whereas General IQ tests cannot possibly be biased, since they depend on the ability to do pattern-matching rather than on prior knowledge.
One doesn&rsquo;t even have to speak English or be literate at all to answer these tests, so the cultural bias argument does not apply to General IQ.
Note that General IQ tests will only work if the test-taker had never taken the tests before, lest this will introduce bias that will inflate the test results.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
But IQ were originally designed to diagnose mentally retarded people. They weren&rsquo;t supposed to meaningfully measure the abstract intelligence of people on the higher half of the normal IQ curve.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That may be true regarding what IQ was <i>originally</i> designed to do, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that it can&rsquo;t also have predictive and explanatory power for other things, besides its original use.
Many concepts have evolved to do much more than what they were designed to do.

<p>
It&rsquo;s easier to be smart today than it was in the past.
In earlier times, there wasn&rsquo;t really any time to work on improving your intelligence since you would have to focus on surviving 24/7 for every hour of every day of your life.
Most earlier humans didn&rsquo;t even get formal educations, and were illiterate.
But since people have ample free time nowadays, there is more time for people to become educated and such.
</p>

<p>
Nowadays, we can stand on the shoulders of all the great intellectual thinkers before us, since we have access to all their knowledge.
Back then, they didn&rsquo;t have access to all that knowledge or good education systems, hence why superstition and religion were so common.
In the past, the intellectuals who were the first to solve great mathematical/scientific/philosophical/etc problems of their time were the ones who had the best genetics.
But now, we can plant the seeds of wisdom, and people can go from there.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect">the Flynn Effect</a> occurred during the 20th century.
Unfortunately, <a href="../FAQs/eugenics-FAQs#flynn-effect">the Flynn Effect ended in the late 1990s</a>, mainly due to dysgenic reproductive practices in the modern world, the failure for first-world education to have continued improving, along with various other reasons, and the removal of selectionary pressures on humanity&rsquo;s genome by modern civilization.
Since the number of metrics used to measure intelligence have greatly expanded since 1900, the things that are the most weakly correlated with IQ have risen exponentially, and there&rsquo;s enough of them to offset the collapsing of the best predictors for IQ at the same time.

<h2 id="IQ-of-europeans-vs-east-asians"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> The IQ of Europeans vs East Asians</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-IQ-of-europeans-vs-east-asians">
<p>
From an empirical perspective in today&rsquo;s world, it&rsquo;s clear that Europeans are as intelligent as East Asians, based on academic achievements and discoveries.
However, it&rsquo;s not clear why this is since East Asians have higher IQs than Europeans, on average.
A common explanation is that East Asians lack creativity and ingenuity, despite being smarter.
Hence, East Asians aren&rsquo;t as good as Europeans at inventing new ideas, for whatever reason.
However, we should expect creativity to correlate with IQ in most cases, so we need to theory to explain why the correlation doesn&rsquo;t occur in this case.
</p>

<p>
Theory: East Asians tend to be marginally smarter than Europeans <i>on average</i> (according to <a href="../epistemology/axiology#g-factors-and-s-factors">IQ metrics</a>), but the reason why Europeans made most of the inventions of modern civilization are:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Europeans probably have higher <i>variation</i> in their IQs (intelligence), and therefore have/had a slightly larger number of &gt;130 IQ individuals, even though their average IQ is slightly lower than the average East Asian IQ.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There is good reason to believe this since the European marriage pattern made it possible for Europeans with similar traits to breed together, which made it possible for higher IQs near the right tail of the curve to arise.</li>
<li>This is consistent with the known facts that European populations have more genetic diversity all other races, how East Asian populations have the least genetic diversity of all races, and how at least &gt;84% of all genes are expressed primarily or exclusively in the brain (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001453#pbio.1001453-Hawrylycz1">Ball, Gilbert, &amp; Overly, 2012</a>; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4243026/">Hawrylycz et al, 2012</a>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Europeans were better educated during the 19th and 20th centuries following the Industrial Revolution (1750-1970). Since there is a finite number of useful inventions that can be made, it was too late for East Asians to invent many things by the time most East Asian populations started getting educated and taught literacy. Notably, most East Asians also use logographic writing systems, which <a href="../language/logographic-systems-pros-cons">create a stronger barrier to literacy than phonetic writing systems</a>, but <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022096521000606">may improve the spatial reasoning of those whose master them</a>.</li>
<li>Ashkenazi Jews have made a disproportionate number of technological contributions and innovations, despite their small size. It could be that lumping Ashkenazi Jewish IQ scores in with European IQ scores boosts the IQ scores of European countries, even though Jews have different genetics than Europeans and higher selectionary pressures for intelligence. Genetic data shows that <a href="https://thuletide.wordpress.com/2021/11/20/infographic-are-jews-white-european-spoiler-no/">Ashkenazi Jews are approximately half European and half Middle Eastern</a>.</li>
<li>The European intellectual tradition was focused on creativity, comprehensiveness, and polymathy. Meanwhile, East Asians selected their elites for millennia by test taking. Thus, we would expect East Asians to perform better on tests, and Europeans to perform better on real world results. This seems to match what we observe in reality.</li>
<li>The cognitive abilities of humans that cannot be measured by IQ probably differ between Europeans and East Asians. Hence, the intelligence of a European is probably different from the intelligence of an East Asian, even when they have the same IQ scores.</li>
<li>Singapore&rsquo;s IQ was probably raised slightly due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_planning_in_Singapore">its past (dirigiste eugenic) population planning policy from 1966 to 1986</a>.</li>

<p>
Edward Dutton claims that average European IQ was the highest it had ever been around the Industrial Revolution, and that it has been steadily declining ever since the start of the Industrial Revolution.
If that&rsquo;s true, then Europeans <i>used to</i> have higher IQs than East Asians, which is believable.
</p>

<p>
Another thing to keep in mind is that Europe industrialized before East Asia did (for multiple reasons), and the colonization of China, Korea, and Taiwan by Japan and European powers, followed by the subsequent Communist takeover in China and North Korea have understandably held back East Asian innovation.
Chinese culture would probably be just as influential in the West as Japanese culture is today, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the Communists winning the Chinese Civil War.
</p>

<p>
Most of the world&rsquo;s atheists are in the Western world and East Asia.
It seems that intelligence correlates with the prevalence of atheism.
