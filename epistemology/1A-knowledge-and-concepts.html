The Sorites Paradox is related to the Raven Paradox. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorites_paradox#Proposed_resolutions">The proposed solutions</a> (including ones by analytic philosophers) to Sorites Paradox don&rsquo;t actually solve it. They&rsquo;re just playing language games.

<div id="outline-container-nested-definitions-of-knowledge" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="nested-definitions-of-knowledge"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> The Three Nested Definitions Of Knowledge</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-nested-definitions-of-knowledge">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The ability to predict (the ability to do the reasoning process).</li>
<li>The ability to do things (procedural knowledge).</li>
<li>The ability to fit form to function (FFF) (the most general definition of knowledge).</li>
</ol>

<p>
The most general definition is fit of form to function (FFF). We might say the flower knows how to attract bees. That&rsquo;s fit of form to function.
</p>

<p>
The procedural definition is the ability to do things. We might say he knows how to skate, he knows how to dance, he knows how to sink a 3-pointer or whatever. So those are the first two.
</p>

<p>
The most specific definition, is the ability to predict, and that&rsquo;s where you get into representations because prediction involves some way of representing reality. You can&rsquo;t talk about prediction until you have a representation scheme because what you&rsquo;re really doing when you predict is you&rsquo;re predicting information within some scheme based on other information in that scheme. So I would say there&rsquo;s no such thing as prediction without a model.
</p>

<p>
I would say that these three things are nested in the sense that the ability to predict enables you to do things, and the ability to do things is part of this more general biological concept of fitting a form to a function.
</p>

<p>
All three of these definitions imply that any acquired knowledge under any of these three definitions is ultimately aimed at solving problem.
</p>

<p>
A fourth definition of knowledge would be descriptive knowledge, which can be used to aid the actions of doing the procedural or prediction based definitions of knowledge, although it cannot be used to solve problems by itself alone.
</p>

<p>
Definition of predict: i
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The ability to predict things and the ability to do things are both pretty intuitive definitions of knowledge that don&rsquo;t require defining terms like truth, belief, or justified. Furthermore, the definition of prediction implies that prediction necessarily must be done based on given information within some scheme. Thus, defining knowledge as the ability to predict is not far removed from sensory experience. This definition of knowledge also doesn&rsquo;t conflict with any of the Gettier Problems.</li>
<li>Also, since the ability to predict implies: some sort of input (usually sense perception, but could also be a model or representation, or an imagined set of premises), concepts, and the logic process step, the ability to predict is basically the same thing as the reasoning process more or less, although &rsquo;predict&rsquo; might be restricted to some subset of purposes out of all the different purpose that the reasoning process could be directed towards.</li>
<li>The prediction-based definition is essentially the ability to do the Reasoning Process in specific contexts, or virtually any context (with the goal of solving a problem that the reason-endowed being chooses to solve).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Knowing how to fit a form to function is a good definition for knowledge because it is analogous to problem solving, but doesn&rsquo;t have to only be about problem-solving. It also seems related to pattern-matching.
</p>

<p>
All three of these definitions, including FFF are all <b>exactly</b> compatible with the definition of Narrow Artificial Intelligence (NIA).
</p>

<p>
Defining knowledge as FFF seems to go against the intuition that knowledge requires a brain or AI machine of some sort that knows the knowledge.
</p>

<p>
However, it is necessary that the FFF definition of knowledge goes against this intuition and is the broadest, most general definition of knowledge there is. The more specific definitions of knowledge are more complex, but they can both be defined in terms of the FFF definition of knowledge, which is ultimately a biological function, which makes sense since the goal of knowledge is to solve problems, and all problems are ultimately created by the existence of life.
</p>

<p>
Also, if someone knows some knowledge, but that knowledge cannot be used to do anything, shouldn&rsquo;t that still be considered knowledge? For example, comparative linguistics doesn&rsquo;t really solve any problems or benefit the human race in some way, although it could potentially supply some statistical knowledge of the likelihood of certain sound changes based on their historical frequency, and establishing all the different relations within various language families may aid the study of anthropology and population genetics.
</p>

<p>
Or better said, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest">if a tree fell in the middle of the forest</a>, does it matter? Would knowing the fact that the tree fell and when it fell count as knowledge, even if it cannot be used to make any conclusions?
</p>

<p>
However, if the knower doesn&rsquo;t perceive the knowledge to be useful or worth keeping, they are likely to forget that useless knowledge anyway since it would not improve their ability to reproduce, nor would it further their existence in some way. The brain is very much designed to not waste its energy or productiveness on things that it knows/thinks that it won&rsquo;t need.
</p>

<p>
What I am getting at here is that these definitions of knowledge seem to exclude <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_knowledge">descriptive knowledge</a> (facts).
</p>


<p>
The AI Effect is very relevant here. Things that used to be considered AI like computer programs that can play Chess and more have a strong tendency to not be considered &ldquo;AI&rdquo; anymore, even though everybody would have considered the inventions of such things to be artificial intelligence before they were created. Likewise, we might not consider a flower that attracts many bees as having FFF knowledge of how to attract bees, but we might be more willing to consider such an ability to be knowledge before flowers were ever able to attract bees in the first place.
</p>

<p>
A General AI would basically be an AI that can do the entire human reasoning process, no matter what input it is taking in through its senses, and no matter what problems it is given to solve.
</p>

<p>
It isn&rsquo;t necessary or desirable to brainstorm a fourth definition of knowledge that is analogous to General AI, because a General AI would basically be capable of doing the prediction / reasoning process definition of knowledge within any context that it finds itself in. The problem with Narrow AI is precisely that NIA cannot function or solve any problems at all when feed input that it wasn&rsquo;t programmed to handle and/or when tasked with solving problems that it is incapable of solving.
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind that an AI necessarily has to be given problems to solve (and would want to solve if it has the capacity to desire doing actions or obtaining things), for the list of reasons below.
</p>

<p>
Just as Reason is useless in a world that is completely absent of problems, Knowledge would also be useless if there are:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>No problems to solve,</li>
<li>No problems that can be solved, <i>or</i></li>
<li>No problems that the reason-endowed being wants/chooses to solve.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Criteria that problems must meet to be worth attempting to solve:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There is a problem to solve,</li>
<li>It is possible to solve the problem, and</li>
<li>Some reason-endowed being would want/choose to solve the problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>
This should make it very clear that the definition of knowledge should necessarily be related to the solving of problems somehow. What good is knowledge if there are no problems that it can, should, or would want to solve?

<p>
The A Priori And A Posteriori Distinction was central to Immanuel Kant&rsquo;s entire philosophy. Kant proposed that Knowledge of Metaphysics is Synthetic, A Priori Knowledge. Metaphysics is supposed to be definition-based knowledge about the world that seeks deeper meaning.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For example, it is one thing to know that a triangle has three sides, but it&rsquo;s another thing to know that all the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, and is thus equivalent to traveling in the exact opposite direction.</li>
<li>In this example, a triangle is defined as having three sides because that is the most distinguishing characteristic that the human mind uses to define a triangle when first learning about it (distinguishing characteristics are most important for classifying and categorizing concepts). So it seems that based on what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZtQXteAE-w">this Wireless Philosophy video</a> said about Kant&rsquo;s Philosophy of Knowledge, Kant believed that Metaphysics and Mathematics was about understanding the world down to its less obvious characteristics, beyond just the most distinguishing characteristics.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Metaphysics isn&rsquo;t supposed to be a bunch of empty definitional truths, metaphysics is supposed to discover truths that are necessary and universal. Metaphysics is supposed to extend our knowledge, to be ampliative.
</p>

<p>
A Priori knowledge is defined as being justified by appealing to the senses.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-basic-beliefs-and-self-evidence">
<p>
Definition of Basic Belief: Basic beliefs (also commonly called foundational beliefs or core beliefs) are, under the epistemological view called foundationalism, the axioms of a belief system. [example needed]
</p>

<p>
Example: Seeing a glass of water or using our senses isn&rsquo;t self-evident, but it is properly basic.

<h3 id="properly-basic-examples"><span class="section-number-3">5.1.</span> Some Examples</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-properly-basic-examples">
<p>
Here too it is relatively specific and concrete propositions rather than their more general and abstract colleagues that are properly basic. Perhaps such items are
</p>

<p>
(11) There are trees,
</p>

<p>
(12) There are other persons,
</p>

<p>
and
</p>

<p>
(13) The world has existed for more than 5 minutes,
</p>

<p>
are not in fact properly basic; it is instead such propositions as
</p>

<p>
There are other persons,
</p>

<p>
(14) I see a tree,
</p>

<p>
(15) that person is pleased,
</p>

<p>
(16) I had breakfast more than an hour ago,
</p>

<p>
The world has existed for more than 5 minutes,
</p>

<p>
Of course propositions of the latter sort immediately and self-evidently entail propositions of the former sort; and perhaps there is thus no harm in speaking of the former as properly basic, even though so to speak is to speak a bit loosely.
</p>

<p>
For properly basic beliefs, these are typically universal statements. The modern foundationalist&rsquo;s criterion for proper basicality, for example, is doubly universal:
</p>

<p>
(18) For any proposition A and person S, A is properly basic for S if and only if A is incorrigible for S or self-evident to S.
</p>

<p>
Some of my beliefs, however, I accept but don&rsquo;t accept on the basis of any other beliefs. Call these beliefs basic. I believe that 2 + 1 = 3, for example, and don&rsquo;t believe it on the basis of other propositions. I also believe that I am seated at my desk, and that there is a mild pain in my right knee.
</p>

<p>
These too are basic to me; I don&rsquo;t believe them on the basis of any other propositions. According to the classical foundationalist, some propositions are properly rightly basic for a person and some are not. Those that are not, are rationally accepted only on the basis of evidence, where the evidence must trace back, ultimately, to what is properly basic. The existence of God, furthermore, is not among the propositions that are properly basic; hence a person is rational in accepting theistic belief only if he has evidence for it.
</p>

<p>
The central point, here, however, is that a belief is properly basic only in certain conditions; these conditions are, we might say, the ground of its justification and, by extension, the ground of the belief itself. In this sense, basic beliefs are not, or are not necessarily, groundless beliefs.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-1-1">
<p>
Foundationalism holds that all beliefs must be justified in order to be known. Beliefs therefore fall into two categories:
</p>

<p>
Beliefs that are properly basic, in that they do not depend upon justification of other beliefs, but on something outside the realm of belief (a &ldquo;non-doxastic justification&rdquo;)
</p>

<p>
Beliefs that derive from one or more basic beliefs, and therefore depend on the basic beliefs for their validity

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A concept is anything or any idea that the human mind can think about.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Every concept has an implicit (or explicit if more conscious) definition in our brains.</li>
<li>Every concept has a definition</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All properties are technically concepts by this definition since we can think about them.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Properties are simpler concepts that can be identified as being parts of more complex concepts.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Properties are used to define complex concepts.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Complex concepts may be defined by properties as part of their definition, and properties have their own definitions.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>So the definition of complex concepts that are defined by properties is really just a definition composed of other definitions.</li>
<li>If more complex concepts are described in simpler and simpler terms until there are no properties left to describe them, definitions that are free from properties are used instead.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At some point, things just can&rsquo;t be more simply described, so definitions are used to communicate what our brains are indescribably and abstractly thinking about.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Definitions have two purposes:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To explain things that we don&rsquo;t understand.</li>
<li>To provide concrete descriptions of what we are talking about.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Every known concept and property has a definition in our brain, even if we can’t verbally describe it.</li>
