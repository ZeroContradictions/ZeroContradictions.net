If you ask anyone &ldquo;Which is larger, the sun or the moon?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Every educated person will say the sun and may even tell you that the sun is about 400 times the size of the moon, by diameter. An uneducated person will probably remember from school that the sun is bigger or they may not and go with what they see.
</p>

<p>
Now you ask &ldquo;Well, they appear to be the same size. So, how do you know that the sun is bigger? How would people have figured this out during ancient times before telescopes and such were invented?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this point the uneducated person may find it puzzling and interesting. The educated person will be offended. &ldquo;Are you questioning my intelligence? You must be a conspiracy theorist.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Very few people will actually know the observations which were needed for us to even question whether the sun and the moon were different sizes. Fewer still will know the experiments done and the body of empirical knowledge required to make us certain that the sun is larger. Yet, the educated people are all certain the sun is bigger. They are also certain they have arrived at this conclusion using rational decision making.
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of educated people who are not very smart. Being mediocre and educated makes people indignant when they are questioned.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-evaluating-tabula-rasa">
<p>
There is no straight-forward answer to whether the mind is tabula rasa or not.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-intro" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="intro"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Is The Human Mind Tabula Rasa?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-intro">
<p>
Tabula Rasa is defined as the epistemological idea that individuals are born without built-in mental content and that therefore all knowledge comes from experience or perception.
</p>

<p>
Mental contents are those items that are thought of as being &ldquo;in&rdquo; the mind, and capable of being formed and manipulated by mental processes and faculties. Examples include thoughts, concepts, memories, emotions, percepts and intentions.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-arguments-for-tabula-rasa" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="arguments-for-tabula-rasa"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Arguments In Favor Of Tabula Rasa</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-arguments-for-tabula-rasa">
<p>
Clearly, humans are not born with a built-in understanding of how reality works, so humans are tabula rasa regarding anything about how reality functions and how to interpret it.
</p>

<p>
Humans do not develop the basic concept of object permanence until one year of age (on average).
</p>

<p>
Humans do not develop the basic concept of the conservation of matter until around 7 years of age (on average).
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, humans have to learn (either by themself or from someone else): mathematics, physics, chemistry, astronomy, philosophy, and other non-universal sciences in order to fully understand reality. Even today, even the smartest humans don&rsquo;t have a complete understanding of how reality works. It is very unlikely that humans will ever be able to know everything.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-arguments-against-tabula-rasa" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="arguments-against-tabula-rasa"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Arguments Against Tabula Rasa</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-arguments-against-tabula-rasa">
<p>
Chickens can learn object permanence after just one day of life. On the other hand, human infants don&rsquo;t understand the concept of object permanence because their brains are developed enough yet. It&rsquo;s a matter of development, not learning. The human brain grows to three times its original size at birth after one year of life. Human brains are far, far more complex, so of course they take longer to develop than a chicken brain.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps, you don&rsquo;t need to be taught that object permanance is a thing, you just eventually become able to process that there&rsquo;s more than what you can sense at the moment. Suppose you have a computer:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It has a slow processor and can&rsquo;t run the &ldquo;object permanance program&rdquo;.</li>
<li>But then you put a much faster processor in it so that it can run the program.</li>
<li>The computer always had the program, it just couldn&rsquo;t process it.</li>
<li>The trouble is that the brain has a lot of unknowns so making broad statements like whether or not the tabula rasa is correct can&rsquo;t really be definitively proven, which is why psychology is honestly just an extension of philosophy.</li>

<h3 id="natal-human-abilities-info"><span class="section-number-3">2.5.</span> More Information On What Humans Are Born With</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-natal-human-abilities-info">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Humans are born with a capacity to learn and master human language. We do know that linguistic formalism is definitely valid to some extent, even if functionalism plays a bigger role in how humans learn and speak language.</li>
<li>As elegantly said in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O5kNPlUV7w">Kurzgesagt video on aesthetics and beauty</a>, humans have a natural preference for straight, horizontal and vertical lines, color, and other features indicating good, safe surroundings and environment.</li>
<li>Humans can be born with a fear of spiders. One could see a spider and instantly be frightened by it despite not knowing exactly what it is or why they are frightened by its appearance. How is it that they are able to see a spider and be afraid of it without ever having seen one before if tabula rasa is true?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The same above applies to a fear of heights. And both fears are prevalent in humans because they were selected by evolution. But of course, there are still humans around that have genetics that don&rsquo;t predispose them to these fears.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most humans are born with a natural preference and attraction for the sex they are attracted to. If humans were completely tabula rasa, then how is it possible that they are attracted to some specific subgroups of humans, but not others? We know that sexual orientation is determined at birth.</li>
<li>Humans are born with a not-yet-developed, but somewhat functional ability for social interaction. Babies will often imitate things that they see (like sticking their tongue out if they see someone looking at them do it).</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-further-thoughts">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Since linguistic formalism does have some validity, clearly all humans have at least some knowledge/ability to learn language.</li>
<li>Evolution has chosen that it is more important for to be born with a better sense for social relations than a sense for reality (at first).</li>
<li>What is the difference between knowledge and ability?</li>
<li>If humans are not born tabula rasa, this might contradict the theory that reason is the only source of knowledge.</li>

<div id="outline-container-conclusion-on-tabula-rasa" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="conclusion-on-tabula-rasa"><span class="section-number-3">2.7.</span> Conclusion On Tabula Rasa</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-conclusion-on-tabula-rasa">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Whether the mind is born Tabula Rasa is not a straight-forward question since it depends on what one defines as being &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;. Also, a human mind at birth grows three times its size within the first year of life, and it might be misleading to ask the question when an infant&rsquo;s mind is significantly different in size, structure, and capabilities compared to a more developed mind.</li>
<li>Evolution has determined that it is important that humans be born with skills relating to human interaction and social skills than being able to understand reality. That being said, I think it might even be impossible that humans could ever be born with an innate ability to understand concepts relating to reality without any sense perception, experience, or education.</li>
<li>Humans are certainly born with natural instincts, as are many animals, but most people would not consider this to be knowledge.</li>
<li>Regardless of whether or not the human mind is born tabula rasa, it is definitely certain that most (if not all) knowledge can never be innately known by newborns.</li>

According to philosophybasics.com: <a href="https://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_foundationalism.html">Foundationalism</a> is the theory in Epistemology that beliefs can be justified based on basic or foundational beliefs (beliefs that give justificatory support to other beliefs). These basic beliefs are said to be self-justifying or self-evident, and do not need to be justified by other beliefs, being an inherently different kind of belief than a non-foundational one. Thus, a belief is epistemically justified either if it is justified by a basic belief or beliefs, or if it is justified by a chain of beliefs that is supported by a basic belief, and on which all the others are ultimately based.

<p>
The three positions share the underlying assumption that beliefs are justified solely by other beliefs, in a chain of reasoning. This is where I think things start to fall apart. I argue that beliefs are not just justified by other beliefs, but by their relation to subjective experience. Beliefs have intentionality. And yes, that is a belief. That belief has intentionality, in and of itself. So, that said, I would be a kind of holistic coherentist, with the caveat that beliefs don&rsquo;t just cohere together, but also have intentionality, meaning they are about subjective experience, which cannot be doubted.

Another take on Foundationalism, Coherentism, and Infinitism is that coherentism breaks down since it&rsquo;s just foundationalism where the foundation is coherence.
The Problem with Infinitism: If justification is just a chain of beliefs that extends indefinitely, then it is impossible to know what is justified. You can&rsquo;t demonstrate the chain or conceptualize it. You can only assert it.

A great analogy would be how those primitive people had seen a Camera took the photo for the first time and I imagined that the camera was taking the spirit of the things captured and poured that into the photo.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They had no basis or foundation for what they believed but they believe that anyway because they could back the knowledge to understand exactly happening plus they already believed in the supernatural religion.</li>
<li>If &ldquo;any sufficiently advanced technology [seems] indistinguishable from magic&rdquo; than any sufficiently ignorant mind will perceive some standard of technology to be magic as well, which reveals at the perception of what magical it&rsquo;s really just that which exceeds the understanding of the mind.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Important: Represent these statements related to technology, magic, and human understanding as conditional statements, and see what the relationship is between all the propositions.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>
Another reason why foundationalism is not the fundamental way how the human brain structures its knowledge about the world is that it is possible for humans to create new beliefs that are not soundly grounded within the set of basic beliefs, axioms, and assumptions.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The primitive people who immediately conjured that the photo from the camera had stored spirits inside of it from the camera did not establish this new belief as something that follows only from what they believe in. Their internal philosophy for understanding how the world works is extremely in accurate, and while they probably do assume that spirits exist, they did not use any logic for concluding that the camera had stored spirit into the photo, nor do they explain how the camera would store spirit into the photo.</li>
<li>If they cannot explain <i>how</i> what they believe and works, yet they choose to hold the beliefs anyway, then they have chosen to believe in something that does not follow from their foundation because they had to make a new assumption about how what they perceive works. they made this new assumption not because human knowledge works according to foundationalism but rather because human knowledge works according to empirically grounded coherentism.</li>
<li>More generally whenever someone tries to understand <i>why</i> <b>before</b> understanding <i>how</i>, they are necessarily breaking the rules of foundationalism and how it is supposed to work. It can therefore be said that scientific knowledge is more Foundationalist and how it is structured (although it also uses coherentism), whereas religion strictly uses coherentism. I&rsquo;ve written more about this in my essay on the <a href="../epistemology/answering-why-and-how.html#why-before-how-problem">Why Before How Problem.</a>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Since science is grounded to human observation and experience, it is by extension usually grounded to reality as well, to the extent that the scientific premises and reasoning are correct.</li>
<li>The arguments in favor of God how are used in philosophy of religion are in attempt to structure religious beliefs according to foundationalism, but this inevitably fails because religious concepts like God are grounded to human imagination rather than human observation and experience. The formal arguments discussed in Philosophy of Religion are thus an attempt to disguise religious foundations as being grounded in reality rather than imagination.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Staying in echo chambers that align with one&rsquo;s beliefs will keep those beliefs to maintain an internal coherency in the believer&rsquo;s mind, even if there are contradictions to the beliefs that are never presented inside the echo chamber, or if the echo chamber&rsquo;s believers never built stable or rigorous foundations for their beliefs in the first place. Echo chambers stay in place because brains assign truth values according to coherentism, and sound foundations are not necessary to hold beliefs, even though said beliefs are likely to be false.</li>

Perhaps the brain goes through an algorithm where every time it sees a pattern that reaffirms its perceived consistency and correctness in its beliefs, it reaffirms that and self-justifies that it is the one that is correct. And the exact opposite happens with lots of the doubting emotion surging if it perceives many contradictions in its beliefs and thinking.
