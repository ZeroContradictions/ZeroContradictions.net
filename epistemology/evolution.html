<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-evolutionary-reasoning">
<p>
It&rsquo;s difficult to predict the evolution of the Future because a single, unpredictable mutation has the potential to completely change all the outcomes within an ecosystem.
The best approach for gaining predictive power about an unpredictable system is to come up with a theory of stability and instability where there are stable states and unstable states.
That will have predictive power because systems will be in a stable state most of the time by definition, whereas the system will not be in unstable states for long periods of time.
This method of reasoning can be more generally applied to:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Biology when there are evolutionarily unstable states and evolutionarily stable states</li>
<li>Game Theory when there are Nash Equilibriums</li>
<li>Economics when there are economically stable states and economically unstable states</li>
<li>Geopolitics when there are stable geopolitical maps and unstable geopolitical maps</li>
<li>Chaos Theory and Differential Equations with equilibrium solutions (e.g. asymptotically stable, unstable, and semi-stable)</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-adaptive-coherence">
<p>
In 2014, <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/11/adaptive-coherence.html">Blithering Genius wrote an essay about what he calls &ldquo;adaptive coherence&rdquo;</a>.
I believe that we can expand on this topic.
It is useful to distinguish between intergenetic adaptive coherence, <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/11/adaptive-coherence.html">genetic-memetic adaptive coherence</a> (the focus of BG&rsquo;s essay), and intermemetic adaptive coherence.
</p>

<p>
The key thing to understand about these types of adaptive coherence is that they should each be understood as bundles of genes and memes that are only adaptive if an organism(s) has all or most of the traits of the bundle.
If an organism fails to have one or more of the traits in the bundle, then the other traits in the <b>adaptive bundle</b> cease to be adaptive for that particular organism(s).
The most optimal adaptive bundles for any organism depend on the organism itself, the organism&rsquo;s environment, and the available genes in a genepool.
The available genes in a genepool restrict what the most theoretically optimal adaptive bundles are.
</p>

<p>
The concept of adaptive bundles may overlap with the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptationism">Adaptationism</a>.
I didn&rsquo;t heard about Adaptationism until after I wrote all this, and I don&rsquo;t know how much of it I would agree with, but I figured that it would be worth mentioning here.

<p>
<a href="../faqs/race#mental-traits-inheritance">Genes and their phenotypes are akin to ingredients in a recipe</a>.
Most genes and mutations cannot be adaptive for an organism unless they work together with other genes and mutations.
Most mutations are maladaptive and biologically harmful to most organisms, since they tend to disrupt a highly ordered morphology.
However, a mutation that is maladaptive in one organism may be adaptive in a different organism(s) with a (vastly) different morphology and/or environment.
There are thus probably millions of known and unknown examples of how genes may work together or work against each other as genetic combinations, or genotypes.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
Perhaps the most well-known and easily explainable examples of intergenetic adaptive coherence are examples of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heterozygote_advantage">heterozygote advantage</a>.
For example, a human must have both the alpha and beta alleles of the hemoglobin gene in order to achieve heterozygote advantage and protect against malaria.
If a human is homozygous for the beta allele, then he/she will have sickle cell anemia, which is maladaptive in all environments.
If a human is homozygous for the alpha allele, then he/she will no genetic protection against malaria, which will be maladaptive in an environment where malaria is a common disease.
The most optimal adaptive bundle for a human in a malaria-prone environment is thus the heterozygous genotype/phenotype.
Heterozygote Advantage could be described as a subcase of adaptive coherence.
</p>

<p>
Intergenetic adaptive coherence can also extend beyond heterozygote advantage.
For example, modern humans evolved have lower tracheae and epiglottises.
They also evolved mental faculties for enabling human language.
All of these adaptions work together to create adaptive, complex communication between humans.
However, none of these traits would be adaptive by themselves.
A lower trachea that is connected to the esophagus makes it easier for humans to choke on their food, compared to other animals (where the esophagus and trachea may be disconnected).
A brain designed to process complex communication consumes more energy.
</p>

<p>
Some humans can use sign language to make do without the ability to speak or hear.
That would give them the benefits of complex communication, but they would be unable to gain the benefits of spoken communication.
Those humans would probably also have the disadvantages of spoken communication, i.e. a respiratory system that makes the body more vulnerable to choking.
Such humans are less adapted than speaking humans, but they are more adapted than humans who cannot communicate at all.
This is a good example of how losing or not having one of the traits of an adaptive bundle may not necessarily cause the entire rest of the bundle to become maladaptive.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, some humans may have suitable respiratory and vocal tracts for producing audible speech sounds, while they also lack the mental faculties for (effective) communication.
The neural structures inside the human brain that are responsible for communication are necessary for communication.
So, if humans don&rsquo;t have those necessary neural structures, then many (or most?) of the genes and traits that are required for communication will be maladaptive.
</p>

<p>
Being heterozygous for the α-globin and β-globin alleles, and having fast twitch muscle fibers are another example of an adaptive bundle.
Since West Africans evolved to have genes that prevent malaria, they also evolved to have other genes that work with the malaria prevention genes. <a href="https://notpoliticallycorrect.me/2017/12/30/malaria-the-sickle-cell-trait-and-fast-twitch-muscle-fibers/">Source</a>

<p>
Some more examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It&rsquo;s adaptive for a primate to have both a tail and lower limbs that are shaped like human hands for climbing trees. For humans, it&rsquo;s adaptive to have lower limbs designed for bipedal running and no tail at all.</li>
<li>Multiple important genes/traits were necessary for creating modern human feet, which are adapted towards bipedal motion, rather than climbing trees.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The thumbs point the same direction at the other phalanges.</li>
<li>The phalanges became shorter.</li>
<li>Arches developed in the feet to support more weight.</li>
<li>The feet bones, tendons, and ligaments strengthened to ease bipedal walking.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Smaller guts, larger brains, muscles optimized for bipedalism, stronger legs, and human feet were all adaptive in human evolution.
(<a href="https://expandingrationality.substack.com/p/diet-and-human-evolution">These traits were also coupled with cooking and eating higher-energy-rich diets</a>, but that&rsquo;s an example of genetic-memetic adaptive coherence.)</li>
<li>Having no limbs would be maladaptive for most animals. But for snakes, the genes for having no limbs proved to be adaptive.</li>
<li>Birds have feathers, wings, and only two legs. Together, these are all conducive for flying (or swimming).</li>
<li>The aerodynamic head structure of a cheetah works with its muscle design for creating a faster animal.</li>
<li>Longer snouts and longer tongues are both adaptive for insectivores, especially when an insectivore has both traits.</li>
<li><a href="https://brittonicmemetics.wordpress.com/2024/07/15/dysgenics/">Cave animals have a tendency to lose their sight and colors</a> as a result of living in a dark environment, where selection for eyesight and camouflage is relaxed. But there is also selection at play here as well: making eyes comes at a cost. If they are not being used, then eliminating them is beneficial for saving the energy.</li>

Blithering Genius has described genetic-memetic adaptive coherence: <i><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/11/adaptive-coherence.html">Adaptive Coherence</a></i>.
</p>

<p>
As a hypothesized example, the memetic tradition where Sub-Saharan Africans carrying heavy/bulky objects on top of their heads may be somewhat facilitated by how they have denser bones and skulls compared to other human races, and how they tend to have smaller brains (both in terms of intelligence and size).
Thus, if they carry heavy stuff on their heads and denser/thicker skulls, their brains suffer less damage and less micro-concussions compared to if Europeans or East Asians carried stuff on top of their heads and their less dense bones.
The implication is that while East Asians or Europeans could carry heavy/bulky objects on top of their heads, they wouldn&rsquo;t be as well-suited to do so as Sub-Saharan Africans.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-intermemetic-adaptive-coherence">
<p>
Intermemetic adaptive coherence is all about memeplexes: sets of memes that reinforce each other.
A lot of intermemetic adaptive coherence is all about how life can accomplish goals more efficiently.
For example, limited (yet pragmatic) government enable free markets by solving problems of cooperation, while free markets can efficiently allocate and produce commodities and much of the government&rsquo;s capital.
<a href="../civilization/georgism-crash-course">Georgism and efficient urban planning also compliment each other well</a>.
Higher intelligence and higher rationality is important for achieving maximal intermemetic adaptive coherence for individuals and societies.
</p>

<p>
Most memetic traditions exist in the first place because they were/are adaptive.
While I am recognizing intermemetic adaptive coherence as a concept, I&rsquo;d say that most adaptive coherence involving memes would be genetic-memetic in practice.
</p>

<p>
Someday, I hope to publish a webpage talking about all my ideas about ideal memetics for a rational humanist / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9gu-Nodlnc">pragmatopian society</a>, which would integrate many phenomena that would enable both genetic-memetic adaptive coherence and intermemetic adaptive coherence.

<div id="outline-container-adaptive-coherence-conclusions" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="adaptive-coherence-conclusions"><span class="section-number-3">2.4.</span> Conclusions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-adaptive-coherence-conclusions">
<p>
The concept of genetic adaptive bundles helps demonstrate why it makes more sense to view <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/10/competition-in-nature.html">Competition in Nature</a> as competition between organisms, rather than competition between genes.
If we only think about biological competition in terms of genes, then we&rsquo;ll fail to recognize the importance of phenotypes, and how different phenotypes affect the ability of organisms to compete against each other.
<a href="../faqs/race#mental-traits-inheritance">The genes in phenotypes are akin to the ingredients in recipes</a>.
Changing an ingredient (gene) can change the recipe (phenotype).
But the analogy isn&rsquo;t perfect because organisms are designed to reproduce, and sexual reproduction enables different combinations of genes to arise in different organisms.
Genes can be mixed and separated in the offspring of organisms.
And ultimately, the most successful organisms are the ones with the best genotypes/phenotypes, i.e. the ones with most of the best <b>adaptive bundles</b> for some particular environment.
Competition between organisms is thus the more holistic and explanatory way to describe competition in Nature, rather than thinking about metaphorical &ldquo;competition&rdquo; between genes.
</p>

<p>
See: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPXJ85W7"><i>Debunking the Selfish Gene: The Phenocentric Theory of Biological Purpose</i> by T. K. Van Allen</a>.
</p>

<p>
In many cases, some adaptive bundles may be more important than others for creating the most adaptive organisms in a particular environment.
In such scenarios, the genes and alleles that are necessary for achieving those adaptive bundles will be selected before the less important adaptive bundles.
Organisms that reproduce via sexual reproduction have the greatest potential to produce offspring that have the greatest number of different <del>genetic combinations</del> genotypes/phenotypes possible.
</p>

<p>
Different environments have different (theoretically) optimal adaptive bundles.
Adaptive bundles are clusters of genes and traits.
Different races and different species are <a href="../faqs/race#what-is-race">defined by having different genetic clusters / correlations of genes and traits</a>.
The concept of adaptive bundles is thus important for describing why human races and many species/subspecies of organisms are different for each other.

<div id="outline-container-maladaptive-memes-persistence" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="maladaptive-memes-persistence"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Why do some maladaptive memes persist in populations?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-maladaptive-memes-persistence">
<p>
In <i><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/12/god-is-telomeme.html">God is a Telomeme</a></i>, Blithering Genius outlined a framework for memetic theory that revolves around &ldquo;traditions&rdquo; and &ldquo;fashions&rdquo;.
Under this theory, traditions tend to be adaptive, not maladaptive.
However, there are notably many traditions that have persisted in populations, despite being maladaptive.
Some examples include:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Kayan people of Myanmar and South Ndebele people of Africa wear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_ring">neck rings</a>, even though they tend to deform the clavicles and ribs.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_binding">Foot binding</a> occurred in China and gradually rose in popularity during the Qing dynasty until it was outlawed in the early 20th century.</li>
<li>Some ethnic groups traditionally do a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_piercing">body piercings</a>, even if they don&rsquo;t confer any health or adaptive benefits.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation#Support_from_women">Female genital mutilation</a> is common in some parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, even though it doesn&rsquo;t confer any health benefits for women at all.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s traditional for Muslims to fast during Ramadan.
Other religions also have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_fasting">fasting rituals</a>.
These traditions are all maladaptive, since there are usually no biological benefits to intentionally fasting.
Deliberately starving oneself of energy for long periods of time will make a person less productive.
In order to conserve energy, cognition and movement both become increasingly impaired throughout the fasts.</li>
<li>Et Cetera</li>
</ul>
<p>
It&rsquo;s counter-intuitive but not impossible that these traditions persisted for so long without disappearing.
This section aims to brainstorm reasons why maladaptive traditions may continue to persist:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The most obvious reason why maladaptive traditions haven&rsquo;t died out is that there simply hasn&rsquo;t passed enough time to cause sufficient death or memetic selection for eliminating them.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
Of course, foot binding eventually became outlawed and unpopular, so that&rsquo;s an example of a maladaptive tradition that eventually died off, as we would normally expect.</li>
<li>Some maladaptive traditions are practiced because they&rsquo;re used to bestow aesthetics, individuality, and ethnic identity.
For example, one reason why the Han Chinese practiced foot binding was to distinguish themselves from non-Han ethnic groups.
The Kayan women wear neck rings to distinguish themselves from women of other ethnic groups.
Many people pierce their bodies in order to distinguish themselves from other people.
It&rsquo;s adaptive for people to establish a personal or collective identity that distinguishes themselves from others, in part because it justifies selfishness.</li>
<li>If a population is destined to explode and collapse due to overpopulation, then it will have high birth rates and low death rates before the population starts declining.
So, even if maladaptive traditions cause health problems or increase the probability of death, it may not matter if the population is bound to find other ways to decline anyway.
This is especially true if everybody or nearly everybody in the population practices the maladaptive traditions.</li>
<li>Above all, <i>the main reason why maladaptive traditions persist is probably because they don&rsquo;t negatively affect fertility rates enough to cause the traditions to die out</i>.
If a group of people practice maladaptive memes, the memes may persist and get transferred to the next generation(s) if the population has high fertility regardless.
For example, female genital mutilation tends to be most common among Muslims.
However, the Islamic memeplex contains enough adaptive behaviors to the point where their collective adaptivity cancels out the maladaptivity of female genital mutilation.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The same reasoning also explains why people who are genetically predisposed to do risky behaviors may continue to have more offspring than the rest of the population.
Risky behaviors may lower their fertility levels since they have the potential to cause accidental deaths or injuries (e.g. drug overdoses, alcohol-related accidents, stunts, etc).
However, less responsible and lower-IQ people are also more likely to have unprotected sex and more children than the rest of the population (in current modern times anyway).
Even if risky behaviors cause more accidental deaths, the higher fertility rates outweigh these maladaptive behaviors, thus causing more genes associated with risk-taking and impulse-seeking to proliferate.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-what-is-r-k-selection">
<p>
R/K selection theory claims the following:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Some species are adapted to live close to the carrying capacity (K-selected), whereas others are adapted to live below the carrying capacity (R-selected).</li>
<li>K-selection favors greater parental investment than R-selection.</li>
<li>K-selection and R-selection cause two sets of mutually-exclusive characteristics (see table below).</li>
</ol>
<p>
I agree with all the reasoning in Blithering Genius&rsquo;s essay, &ldquo;<a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/01/rk-selection-theory-is-bogus.html">Why r/K Selection Theory is Bogus</a>&rdquo;, as to why these claims are false.
However, I don&rsquo;t believe that all the patterns proposed in the third claim are entirely non-existent.
Instead, I propose that some of the patterns are oversimplifications and consequences of a more accurate ecological model.
As it pertains to modern humans, this model is partly described in &ldquo;<a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html">Life is Violent</a>&rdquo; by Blithering Genius and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_history_theory">Life History Theory</a>.

This is fallacious because different organisms have different life cycles, which affect their abilities to reproduce.
It&rsquo;s not meaningful to compare organisms that have significantly different life cycles.
To do so would be to compare apples with oranges.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A bacterium reproduces by simple cell division, so it only has 2 &ldquo;offspring&rdquo; at most.
(As with most things in biology, there are some weird exceptions.)
</p>

<p>
Reproduction is not a contest between men, bacteria, salmon and oak trees.
It is not necessarily a contest, although it often involves a struggle for resources or mates, especially with other members of one&rsquo;s species.
</p>

<p>
Different types of life have different life-cycles.
Some produce millions of offspring, of which very few survive to adulthood.
Humans have relatively few offspring, compared to oak trees and oysters.
It does not follow that we are less successful, on average.
The life-cycles of oak trees, oysters and humans are all successful reproductive strategies.
That&rsquo;s why oak trees, oysters and humans exist.

<p>
The r/K selection dichotomy is thus only meaningful when comparing between different taxa that are closely related.
Closely related taxa tend to have more similar life cycles and tend to occupy more similar niches.
Categorizing different human races as &ldquo;r-selected&rdquo; or &ldquo;k-selected&rdquo; thus has some meaning, but not as much as the <a href="#human-races-patterns">improved terminology that I propose</a>.
This essay focuses mainly on comparing different human races.
</p>


<hr>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_K_theory">Differential <i>K</i> Theory</a> is an attempt to apply r/K selection theory to human races.
It proposes that the evolution of every race was affected by a &ldquo;<i>K</i> factor&rdquo;, which theoretically affects and explains multiple race differences in fertility, IQ, criminality, and sexual anatomy and behavior.
Europeans, East Asians, and other intelligent races are supposedly K-selected, while less intelligent races are supposedly r-selected.
Parental investment presumably favors quality offspring in the former, while favoring quantity in the latter.
Differential <i>K</i> Theory is popular among many <a href="../faqs/race#not-racists">race idealists</a>, since it justifies their ideology.
</p>

<p>
However, Differential <i>K</i> only raises the question as to what factors affect the <i>K</i> factor.
There are no clear or coherent answers to this question.
It&rsquo;s also not clear how different <i>K</i> factors would affect the selection for intelligence in different populations around the world.
And even if the <a href="#what-is-r-k-selection">patterns associated with r-selected and K-selected species</a> map seemingly map well onto some human races, it&rsquo;s still ambiguous whether some races should be classified as &ldquo;r-selected&rdquo; or &ldquo;K-selected&rdquo;.

As mentioned in &ldquo;<a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html">Life is Violent</a>&rdquo;, human populations have historically been limited by a combination of disease, famine, and war.
All human populations are known to have dealt with these causes of death at one point or another in their histories, but most populations were affected by each of these factors to different degrees.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
War is not an alternative to peace and prosperity.
War is an alternative to famine and disease, and famine almost always leads to war.
If you and your children are facing death by starvation, then you will kill other people to get food.
So, unless disease kills most children before adulthood, population growth will eventually lead to war.
That is why war is a human universal.
Our ancestors fought to survive.
We inherited the genes and memes of the winners, not the losers.

</p>
</blockquote>




<p>
All populations evolved to live near the carrying capacities of their respective environments, not just &ldquo;K-selected&rdquo; populations.
Every population is thus better described by the main factor that had historically kept their populations below the carrying capacity of their respective environments.
</p>

<p>
By using better descriptors, the real reasons why these races have higher intelligence and others becomes more clear and also becomes more clear why some races or more violent and such than others.
Words like <b>disease-resistant</b>, <b>famine-resistant</b>, or <b>reproduction-optimized</b> / <b>war-selected</b> / <b>fighter-optimized</b>, etc are better descriptors.
We know that races that were limited by the disease is enough to become disease-resistant were able to develop more stable civilizations which thus selected for higher populations.
</p>


<p>
For recent human history, it&rsquo;s accurate to make some generalizations about human populations:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>European, Jewish, and East Asian populations were mainly limited by diseases.</li>
<li>American Indian, sub-Saharan African, and Central Asian populations were mainly limited by wars.</li>
<li>South Asian and Austronesian populations were mainly limited by famines.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As it turns out, the races that are theorized to be K-selected were usually limited by diseases and such.
We could describe them as <b>disease-resistant</b><sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>.
</p>


<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>
South Asia had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9Y0XpdfEek">10-15 major famines within 200 years in the 1700-1900s</a>.
As a consequence, South Asians evolved traits that are adaptive to surviving famines, including: smaller frames, low lean muscle mass, insulin resistance, and higher body fat percentages.
&#x2013; <a href="../faqs/race#athletic-performance">Philosophy of Race FAQs</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As a whole, the average IQ of India is roughly between the average IQ of sub-Saharan Africans and Europeans.
I don&rsquo;t know how r/K theorists would classify South Asians, one way or the other, but they don&rsquo;t seem to have all of the physical traits associated with the so-called r-selected races, like lower intelligence, higher testosterone, maybe even earlier pubertal development, and what not.
South Asians also seem to have some traits there are better associated with K-selected races, like somewhat higher IQ, some disease resistance, and other traits.
</p>


<hr>
<p>
&ldquo;r-selected&rdquo; organisms tend to have earlier pubertal development, shorter pregnancies, higher impulsivity, higher testosterone, and lower abstract intelligence.
Surely, earlier puberty, short pregnancies, and other traits should make it easier to have more children within shorter periods of time.
</p>

<p>
We also know that blacks and American Indians have higher testosterone levels which made For fighting trouble war conflicts.
The race idealists want to believe in r/K selection theory because it provides a narrative for explaining why some races have higher or lower intelligence and others.
Supposedly the K-selected races have higher intelligence because their ancestors supposedly invested into making better quality humans rather than more quantity lower quality humans.
However, this actually hides the truth it&rsquo;s not that they invest in becoming better humans that they are different selection or pressures which selected for different traits in these populations.
</p>

<p>
As for r-selected populations, the proper descriptor to use would be for the traits evolved that enable faster and greater rate of reproduction rather than traits that increase survival and prevent death.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
All populations have the potential to grow exponentially towards infinity, but the r-selected populations still grow slightly faster than the k-selected populations.
This can be demonstrated with some basic math.
</p>

<p>
A key thing to know is that the r-selection and K-selection dichotomy applies best to environments where there are abundant resources.
In the real world, we can observe that sub-Saharan Africans have higher fertility rates than Europeans and East Asians.
However, no race would perform relatively well if they were living outside their ancestral environments <i>without</i> abundant resources.
For example, sub-Saharan Africans would not have higher fertility if they were placed in pre-industrial Europe or pre-industrial East Asia where scarcity was common because they are not adapted to those environments.
Hence, they would have poor and lower fertility rates then the races are already adapted to those environments.
</p>

<p>
The same is true for K-selected races, if they were placed in environments associated with r-selected races.
We don&rsquo;t see a pattern until or unless both races are placed inside environment of abundance.
when there are abundant resources, the r-selected races are able to have higher fertility rates than the K-selected races.
</p>

<p>
Although we could argue that the higher fertility of r-selected races is because they have lower access to birth control.
In many cases, this is true, but even in countries where birth control is cheap and accessible like the United States, they r-selected racist still have higher fertility rates in the K-selected races.
</p>



<p>
For non-human animals, we could use descriptors like predation-resistant, or other descriptors that describe how their populations were eliminated.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
An invasive species occurs when a species from a foreign environment is better adapted to the native environment than the native species itself.
So while we would naturally expect species to be best adapted to their own environments, species can sometimes be adapted to environments that they did not evolve in if such environments pose little competition against them.
hypothetically, the Europeans could’ve killed all the Africans and populate the continent for themselves, in which case the Europeans would’ve been an invasive species.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
There might be a meaningful distinction between opportunistic species that are adapted to exploit new niches quickly, and those that are adapted to live in stable environments where there is little available energy to support new individuals.
Perhaps that is the idea.
Let&rsquo;s assume so.
What traits are most useful to an opportunistic organism?
What traits are most useful at exploiting an environment with occasional surpluses of energy?
Keep in mind that the organism has to find the niche, colonize it, and then escape from it when it closes up.
</p>

<p>
It is true that high fertility could be useful in rapidly colonizing a new niche.
For example, aphids use cloning to rapidly colonize plants.
They can switch between sexual and asexual reproduction, depending on the situation.
Fruit flies are another example.
They rapidly colonize ripe fruit before it rots.
They have high fertility compared to mammals, but not unusually high for insects.
They have very short lives, and that is a key adaptation, because ripe fruit doesn&rsquo;t last long.
Another example is the fireweed plant.
Fireweed colonizes landscapes that have been recently logged or burned over.
Fireweed produces a lot of seeds that have cottony down attached to them, so they float away on the breeze to colonize a new area.
Aphids, fruit flies and fireweed all have high fertility, although not exceptionally high compared to other similar organisms.
Their main adaptation is rapid growth and/or reaching maturity quickly.

They joined forces in pushing the Blackfeet, Bloods, and Piegan southwestward out of the plains bordering Saskatchewan river, and up to the termination of inter-tribal warfare remained constant enemies of these other Algonquians. The Cree inheritance of the historic Sioux hostility toward the Chippewa was not lessened by the friendly reception they accorded the renegade Assiniboine, for whom the Sioux entertained bitter hatred mixed with professed contempt.

<p>
There&rsquo;s not a single historical account of American Indian tribes that doesn&rsquo;t involve warfare with other tribes.
Once humans are the apex predator, unless there is a very high rate of disease, the majority of deaths will be from warfare because people who let their children die of starvation rather than going to war, be eliminated by those who fight for their children&rsquo;s survival.
It&rsquo;s not unreasonable to conclude that the high historical prevalence of American Indian wars may have selected for genes that predispose American Indian descendants to <a href="../faqs/race#crime-rates-gap">commit more crimes</a>, compared to other races.
</p>

<p>
There&rsquo;s no way to precisely calculate the actual percentages regarding the historical causes of death since we don&rsquo;t have unbiased samples of the deaths, but we can infer most deaths were from war based on these historical accounts and the biological reasoning given here.
We should also recognize that most of the academic estimates for the number of humans who have historically died from warfare are probably great underestimates because 1. war victims don&rsquo;t get nice noticeable burials, 2. less than 1% of living remains ever get fossilized, and 3. there is an ideological bias in Academia.
</p>

<p>
Some estimates of the pre-Columbian population of the Americas are between 7-10 million, and others estimate ~50 million, but whatever it was, it&rsquo;s likely that it fluctuated a lot with population booms/explosions and war busts.

</p>

</div>
<p>
This misses the point.
We never claimed that Eurasia didn&rsquo;t have any wars.
The point is that the death tolls from most of those wars weren&rsquo;t enough to destroy or destabilize Old World civilizations.
Most of the wars listed in those Wikipedia articles occurred on local scales (not the entire continent), and weren&rsquo;t sufficient to keep the European population below the carrying capacity.
That is especially true for wars that mainly killed men, and few women and/or children.
Disease was the main factor that limited European populations.
European wars evidently weren&rsquo;t as destructive to European civilizations, as Amerindian wars were destructive to Amerindian civilizations.
</p>

<p>
There are many examples of Native American societies/civilizations that collapsed and reverted to simpler ways of life.
We don&rsquo;t really see that in Eurasia.
Political units collapse, and there were some collapses of large empires, but not the reversion to much simpler modes of existence.
e.g. the collapse of the Roman Empire didn&rsquo;t end civilization in Europe.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="org7631d7e">
<p>
But most of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll">the deadliest wars of all time</a> occurred in Eurasia, not the Americas.
</p>

</div>
<p>
Of course, Eurasian wars had higher death tolls.
This isn&rsquo;t surprising because Eurasia had higher populations than the rest of the world for most of global human history.
It was possible for Eurasia to have deadlier wars because Eurasia had more people to kill to begin with.
Eurasia had larger human populations than the Americas because Eurasia usually had more robust civilizations that could sustain higher populations.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s thus normal for continents with stronger civilizations to have deadlier wars.
This is true, even given that wars were usually not the main cause of death in most Eurasian civilizations.
Eurasian wars were less frequent, most locations only had wars that occurred every few hundred years or so, and most Eurasian wars didn&rsquo;t usually wipe out entire civilizations or technological complexity.
By contrast, Amerindian wars tended to occur more frequently, and the biggest wars usually wiped out formerly existing Amerindian civilizations.
As far as we know, Amerindian wars tended to have lower death tolls, since the environments in the Americas had lower carrying capacities.

Reason and knowledge are not the <i>only</i> reason why humans rule the world.
If we examine other mammals like orangutans, elephants, and cetaceans, we will find that they are surprisingly intelligent.
They have demonstrated exceptional capabilities to memorize concepts, do arithmetic, communicate with humans on a limited level, demonstrate self-awareness, have emotions, organize advanced social structures, and have advanced communication.
Since advanced knowledge and reasoning skills are not limited to just only humans, it must be concluded that there are therefore other reasons why humans rule the world.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-humans-vs-runner-ups">
<p>
The reason why humans have risen above orangutans, elephants, cetaceans, giant pacific octopi, and other mammals/animals is that we are able to combine reason, communication/interaction, and our capable bodies/appendages better than any other organism in our world.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Humans have the best reasoning and knowledge skills in the world.</li>
<li>Humans have the most complex communication system and societies of any life known to mankind.
Human language can express infinite quantities of ideas and information.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GimCcrwYxdE">Orcas</a> and possibly some other animals are also known to have complex communication, but it&rsquo;s difficult for anyone to know how it compares to human communication.</li>
<li>Humans have the most capable appendages and anatomies in the world. Human hands can grasp tools and build many things with relative ease. By comparison, cetaceans and elephants don&rsquo;t have the same appendages or anatomies to enable them to build the same things that a human can, such as fires, wheels, shelters, compasses, aqueducts, medicine, modern computers, and all the other things humans have invented.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Humans also have long lifespans compared to other relatively intelligent species.
The giant pacific octopus is possibly the smartest of all invertebrates, but since its lifespan only lasts 3-5 years at max, it doesn&rsquo;t have much time to do the same productive work that humans can do before they die.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, intelligence is definitely the most important out of the four skills / qualities, but the other skills would both be rendered useless without the ability to reason.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-rivaling-modern-humans">
<p>
With all of this in mind, we can conclude that intelligent life that is on par with human life is most likely to at least have the following six characteristics:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>High Capacity to Reason (Intelligence)</li>
<li>Volition (the ability to reason implies volition)</li>
<li>Sophisticated Methods of Communication</li>
<li>Emotion</li>
<li>Limbs that are optimal for building tools and such</li>
<li>Sufficiently long lifespan</li>
</ul>

Of course, when I say &ldquo;disease-resistant&rdquo;, there are many different types of diseases and different populations will be better adapted to different diseases than others.
I&rsquo;m also talking about diseases that mainly affect infant children and survival into adulthood, rather than developmental or elderly diseases.
Although the concept of being &ldquo;disease-resistant&rdquo; is somewhat ambiguous, phrases like &ldquo;Europeans are disease-resistant&rdquo; or phrases like &ldquo;East Asians are disease-resistant&rdquo; usually implicitly signify which diseases are being talked about, since races evolved in environments that spread different diseases.
