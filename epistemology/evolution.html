<p>
It&rsquo;s difficult to predict the evolution of the Future because a single, unpredictable mutation has the potential to completely change all the outcomes within an ecosystem.
The best approach for gaining predictive power about an unpredictable system is to come up with a theory of stability and instability where there are stable states and unstable states.
That will have predictive power because systems will be in a stable state most of the time by definition, whereas the system will not be in unstable states for long periods of time.
This method of reasoning can be more generally applied to:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Biology when there are evolutionarily unstable states and evolutionarily stable states</li>
<li>Game Theory when there are Nash Equilibriums</li>
<li>Economics when there are economically stable states and economically unstable states</li>
<li>Geopolitics when there are stable geopolitical maps and unstable geopolitical maps</li>
<li>Chaos Theory and Differential Equations with equilibrium solutions (e.g. asymptotically stable, unstable, and semi-stable)</li>

<h2 id="adaptive-coherence"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Adaptive Coherence</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-adaptive-coherence">
<p>
In 2014, <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/11/adaptive-coherence.html">Blithering Genius wrote an essay about what he calls &ldquo;adaptive coherence&rdquo;</a>.
I believe that we can expand on this topic.
It is useful to distinguish between intergenetic adaptive coherence, <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/11/adaptive-coherence.html">genetic-memetic adaptive coherence</a> (the focus of BG&rsquo;s essay), and intermemetic adaptive coherence.
</p>

<p>
The key thing to understand about these types of adaptive coherence is that they should each be understood as bundles of genes and memes that are only adaptive if an organism(s) has all or most of the traits of the bundle.
If an organism fails to have one or more of the traits in the bundle, then the other traits in the <b>adaptive bundle</b> cease to be adaptive for that particular organism(s).
The most optimal adaptive bundles for any organism depend on the organism itself, the organism&rsquo;s environment, and the available genes in a genepool.
The available genes in a genepool restrict what the most theoretically optimal adaptive bundles are.
</p>

<p>
The concept of adaptive bundles may overlap with the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptationism">Adaptationism</a>.
I didn&rsquo;t heard about Adaptationism until after I wrote all this, and I don&rsquo;t know how much of it I would agree with, but I figured that it would be worth mentioning here.

<p>
<a href="../faqs/race#mental-traits-inheritance">Genes and their phenotypes are akin to ingredients in a recipe</a>.
Most genes and mutations cannot be adaptive for an organism unless they work together with other genes and mutations.
Most mutations are maladaptive and biologically harmful to most organisms, since they tend to disrupt a highly ordered morphology.
However, a mutation that is maladaptive in one organism may be adaptive in a different organism(s) with a (vastly) different morphology and/or environment.
There are thus probably millions of known and unknown examples of how genes may work together or work against each other as genetic combinations, or genotypes.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
Perhaps the most well-known and easily explainable examples of intergenetic adaptive coherence are examples of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heterozygote_advantage">heterozygote advantage</a>.
For example, a human must have both the alpha and beta alleles of the hemoglobin gene in order to achieve heterozygote advantage and protect against malaria.
If a human is homozygous for the beta allele, then he/she will have sickle cell anemia, which is maladaptive in all environments.
If a human is homozygous for the alpha allele, then he/she will no genetic protection against malaria, which will be maladaptive in an environment where malaria is a common disease.
The most optimal adaptive bundle for a human in a malaria-prone environment is thus the heterozygous genotype/phenotype.
Heterozygote Advantage could be described as a subcase of adaptive coherence.
</p>

<p>
Intergenetic adaptive coherence can also extend beyond heterozygote advantage.
For example, modern humans evolved have lower tracheae and epiglottises.
They also evolved mental faculties for enabling human language.
All of these adaptions work together to create adaptive, complex communication between humans.
However, none of these traits would be adaptive by themselves.
A lower trachea that is connected to the esophagus makes it easier for humans to choke on their food, compared to other animals (where the esophagus and trachea may be disconnected).
A brain designed to process complex communication consumes more energy.
</p>

<p>
Some humans can use sign language to make do without the ability to speak or hear.
That would give them the benefits of complex communication, but they would be unable to gain the benefits of spoken communication.
Those humans would probably also have the disadvantages of spoken communication, i.e. a respiratory system that makes the body more vulnerable to choking.
Such humans are less adapted than speaking humans, but they are more adapted than humans who cannot communicate at all.
This is a good example of how losing or not having one of the traits of an adaptive bundle may not necessarily cause the entire rest of the bundle to become maladaptive.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, some humans may have suitable respiratory and vocal tracts for producing audible speech sounds, while they also lack the mental faculties for (effective) communication.
The neural structures inside the human brain that are responsible for communication are necessary for communication.
So, if humans don&rsquo;t have those necessary neural structures, then many (or most?) of the genes and traits that are required for communication will be maladaptive.
</p>

<p>
Being heterozygous for the α-globin and β-globin alleles, and having fast twitch muscle fibers are another example of an adaptive bundle.
Since West Africans evolved to have genes that prevent malaria, they also evolved to have other genes that work with the malaria prevention genes. <a href="https://notpoliticallycorrect.me/2017/12/30/malaria-the-sickle-cell-trait-and-fast-twitch-muscle-fibers/">Source</a>

<p>
Some more examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It&rsquo;s adaptive for a primate to have both a tail and lower limbs that are shaped like human hands for climbing trees. For humans, it&rsquo;s adaptive to have lower limbs designed for bipedal running and no tail at all.</li>
<li>Multiple important genes/traits were necessary for creating modern human feet, which are adapted towards bipedal motion, rather than climbing trees.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The thumbs point the same direction at the other phalanges.</li>
<li>The phalanges became shorter.</li>
<li>Arches developed in the feet to support more weight.</li>
<li>The feet bones, tendons, and ligaments strengthened to ease bipedal walking.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Smaller guts, larger brains, muscles optimized for bipedalism, stronger legs, and human feet were all adaptive in human evolution.
(<a href="https://expandingrationality.substack.com/p/diet-and-human-evolution">These traits were also coupled with cooking and eating higher-energy-rich diets</a>, but that&rsquo;s an example of genetic-memetic adaptive coherence.)</li>
<li>Having no limbs would be maladaptive for most animals. But for snakes, the genes for having no limbs proved to be adaptive.</li>
<li>Birds have feathers, wings, and only two legs. Together, these are all conducive for flying (or swimming).</li>
<li>The aerodynamic head structure of a cheetah works with its muscle design for creating a faster animal.</li>
<li>Longer snouts and longer tongues are both adaptive for insectivores, especially when an insectivore has both traits.</li>
<li><a href="https://brittonicmemetics.wordpress.com/2024/07/15/dysgenics/">Cave animals have a tendency to lose their sight and colors</a> as a result of living in a dark environment, where selection for eyesight and camouflage is relaxed. But there is also selection at play here as well: making eyes comes at a cost. If they are not being used, then eliminating them is beneficial for saving the energy.</li>

Blithering Genius has described genetic-memetic adaptive coherence: <i><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/11/adaptive-coherence.html">Adaptive Coherence</a></i>.
</p>

<p>
As a hypothesized example, the memetic tradition where Sub-Saharan Africans carrying heavy/bulky objects on top of their heads may be somewhat facilitated by how they have denser bones and skulls compared to other human races, and how they tend to have smaller brains (both in terms of intelligence and size).
Thus, if they carry heavy stuff on their heads and denser/thicker skulls, their brains suffer less damage and less micro-concussions compared to if Europeans or East Asians carried stuff on top of their heads and their less dense bones.
The implication is that while East Asians or Europeans could carry heavy/bulky objects on top of their heads, they wouldn&rsquo;t be as well-suited to do so as Sub-Saharan Africans.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-intermemetic-adaptive-coherence">
<p>
Intermemetic adaptive coherence is all about memeplexes: sets of memes that reinforce each other.
A lot of intermemetic adaptive coherence is all about how life can accomplish goals more efficiently.
For example, limited (yet pragmatic) government enable free markets by solving problems of cooperation, while free markets can efficiently allocate and produce commodities and much of the government&rsquo;s capital.
<a href="../civilization/georgism-crash-course">Georgism and efficient urban planning also compliment each other well</a>.
Higher intelligence and higher rationality is important for achieving maximal intermemetic adaptive coherence for individuals and societies.
</p>

<p>
Most memetic traditions exist in the first place because they were/are adaptive.
While I am recognizing intermemetic adaptive coherence as a concept, I&rsquo;d say that most adaptive coherence involving memes would be genetic-memetic in practice.
</p>

<p>
Someday, I hope to publish a webpage talking about all my ideas about ideal memetics for a rational humanist / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9gu-Nodlnc">pragmatopian society</a>, which would integrate many phenomena that would enable both genetic-memetic adaptive coherence and intermemetic adaptive coherence.

<div id="outline-container-adaptive-coherence-conclusions" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="adaptive-coherence-conclusions"><span class="section-number-3">2.4.</span> Conclusions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-adaptive-coherence-conclusions">
<p>
The concept of genetic adaptive bundles helps demonstrate why it makes more sense to view <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/10/competition-in-nature.html">Competition in Nature</a> as competition between organisms, rather than competition between genes.
If we only think about biological competition in terms of genes, then we&rsquo;ll fail to recognize the importance of phenotypes, and how different phenotypes affect the ability of organisms to compete against each other.
<a href="../faqs/race#mental-traits-inheritance">The genes in phenotypes are akin to the ingredients in recipes</a>.
Changing an ingredient (gene) can change the recipe (phenotype).
But the analogy isn&rsquo;t perfect because organisms are designed to reproduce, and sexual reproduction enables different combinations of genes to arise in different organisms.
Genes can be mixed and separated in the offspring of organisms.
And ultimately, the most successful organisms are the ones with the best genotypes/phenotypes, i.e. the ones with most of the best <b>adaptive bundles</b> for some particular environment.
Competition between organisms is thus the more holistic and explanatory way to describe competition in Nature, rather than thinking about metaphorical &ldquo;competition&rdquo; between genes.
</p>

<p>
See: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPXJ85W7"><i>Debunking the Selfish Gene: The Phenocentric Theory of Biological Purpose</i> by T. K. Van Allen</a>.
</p>

<p>
In many cases, some adaptive bundles may be more important than others for creating the most adaptive organisms in a particular environment.
In such scenarios, the genes and alleles that are necessary for achieving those adaptive bundles will be selected before the less important adaptive bundles.
Organisms that reproduce via sexual reproduction have the greatest potential to produce offspring that have the greatest number of different <del>genetic combinations</del> genotypes/phenotypes possible.
</p>

<p>
Different environments have different (theoretically) optimal adaptive bundles.
Adaptive bundles are clusters of genes and traits.
Different races and different species are <a href="../faqs/race#what-is-race">defined by having different genetic clusters / correlations of genes and traits</a>.
The concept of adaptive bundles is thus important for describing why human races and many species/subspecies of organisms are different for each other.

<div id="outline-container-maladaptive-memes-persistence" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="maladaptive-memes-persistence"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Why do some maladaptive memes persist in populations?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-maladaptive-memes-persistence">
<p>
In <i><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/12/god-is-telomeme.html">God is a Telomeme</a></i>, Blithering Genius outlined a framework for memetic theory that revolves around &ldquo;traditions&rdquo; and &ldquo;fashions&rdquo;.
Under this theory, traditions tend to be adaptive, not maladaptive.
However, there are notably many traditions that have persisted in populations, despite being maladaptive.
Some examples include:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Kayan people of Myanmar and South Ndebele people of Africa wear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_ring">neck rings</a>, even though they tend to deform the clavicles and ribs.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot_binding">Foot binding</a> occurred in China and gradually rose in popularity during the Qing dynasty until it was outlawed in the early 20th century.</li>
<li>Some ethnic groups traditionally do a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_piercing">body piercings</a>, even if they don&rsquo;t confer any health or adaptive benefits.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation#Support_from_women">Female genital mutilation</a> is common in some parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, even though it doesn&rsquo;t confer any health benefits for women at all.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s traditional for Muslims to fast during Ramadan.
Other religions also have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_fasting">fasting rituals</a>.
These traditions are all maladaptive, since there are usually no biological benefits to intentionally fasting.
Deliberately starving oneself of energy for long periods of time will make a person less productive.
In order to conserve energy, cognition and movement both become increasingly impaired throughout the fasts.</li>
<li>Et Cetera</li>
</ul>
<p>
It&rsquo;s counter-intuitive but not impossible that these traditions persisted for so long without disappearing.
This section aims to brainstorm reasons why maladaptive traditions may continue to persist:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The most obvious reason why maladaptive traditions haven&rsquo;t died out is that there simply hasn&rsquo;t passed enough time to cause sufficient death or memetic selection for eliminating them.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
Of course, foot binding eventually became outlawed and unpopular, so that&rsquo;s an example of a maladaptive tradition that eventually died off, as we would normally expect.</li>
<li>Some maladaptive traditions are practiced because they&rsquo;re used to bestow aesthetics, individuality, and ethnic identity.
For example, one reason why the Han Chinese practiced foot binding was to distinguish themselves from non-Han ethnic groups.
The Kayan women wear neck rings to distinguish themselves from women of other ethnic groups.
Many people pierce their bodies in order to distinguish themselves from other people.
It&rsquo;s adaptive for people to establish a personal or collective identity that distinguishes themselves from others, in part because it justifies selfishness.</li>
<li>If a population is destined to explode and collapse due to overpopulation, then it will have high birth rates and low death rates before the population starts declining.
So, even if maladaptive traditions cause health problems or increase the probability of death, it may not matter if the population is bound to find other ways to decline anyway.
This is especially true if everybody or nearly everybody in the population practices the maladaptive traditions.</li>
<li>Above all, <i>the main reason why maladaptive traditions persist is probably because they don&rsquo;t negatively affect fertility rates enough to cause the traditions to die out</i>.
If a group of people practice maladaptive memes, the memes may persist and get transferred to the next generation(s) if the population has high fertility regardless.
For example, female genital mutilation tends to be most common among Muslims.
However, the Islamic memeplex contains enough adaptive behaviors to the point where their collective adaptivity cancels out the maladaptivity of female genital mutilation.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The same reasoning also explains why people who are genetically predisposed to do risky behaviors may continue to have more offspring than the rest of the population.
Risky behaviors may lower their fertility levels since they have the potential to cause accidental deaths or injuries (e.g. drug overdoses, alcohol-related accidents, stunts, etc).
However, less responsible and lower-IQ people are also more likely to have unprotected sex and more children than the rest of the population (in current modern times anyway).
Even if risky behaviors cause more accidental deaths, the higher fertility rates outweigh these maladaptive behaviors, thus causing more genes associated with risk-taking and impulse-seeking to proliferate.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-what-is-r-k-selection">
<p>
R/K selection theory claims the following:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Some species are adapted to live close to the carrying capacity (K-selected), whereas others are adapted to live below the carrying capacity (R-selected).</li>
<li>K-selection favors greater parental investment than R-selection.</li>
<li>K-selection and R-selection cause two sets of mutually-exclusive characteristics (see table below).</li>
</ol>
<p>
I agree with all the reasoning in Blithering Genius&rsquo;s essay, &ldquo;<a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/01/rk-selection-theory-is-bogus.html">Why R/K Selection Theory is Bogus</a>&rdquo;, as to why these claims are false.
However, I don&rsquo;t believe that all the patterns proposed in the third claim are entirely non-existent.
Instead, I propose that some of the patterns are oversimplifications and consequences of a more accurate ecological model.
As it pertains to modern humans, this model is partly described in &ldquo;<a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html">Life is Violent</a>&rdquo; by Blithering Genius and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_history_theory">Life History Theory</a>.
I recommend reading all three of the prior linked pages if you haven&rsquo;t already, since they are necessary for understanding the rest of this webpage.

People who herd animals tend to be taller, whether Nords or Maasai.
People who grow rice tend to have short legs and light upper bodies.
People who use hoes to farm yams have big butts.
Europeans tend to be relatively strong and tall, because their ancestors used animals extensively for food and traction.

<p>
Furthermore, most R/K selection theorists tend to categorize <i>all</i> organisms as being either &ldquo;R-selected&rdquo; or &ldquo;K-selected&rdquo;.
This is fallacious because different organisms have different life cycles, which affect their abilities to reproduce.
It&rsquo;s not meaningful to compare organisms that have significantly different life cycles.
To do so would be to compare apples with oranges.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A bacterium reproduces by simple cell division, so it only has 2 &ldquo;offspring&rdquo; at most.
(As with most things in biology, there are some weird exceptions.)
</p>

<p>
Reproduction is not a contest between men, bacteria, salmon and oak trees.
It is not necessarily a contest, although it often involves a struggle for resources or mates, especially with other members of one&rsquo;s species.
</p>

<p>
Different types of life have different life-cycles.
Some produce millions of offspring, of which very few survive to adulthood.
Humans have relatively few offspring, compared to oak trees and oysters.
It does not follow that we are less successful, on average.
The life-cycles of oak trees, oysters and humans are all successful reproductive strategies.
That&rsquo;s why oak trees, oysters and humans exist.

<p>
The R/K selection dichotomy is thus only meaningful when comparing between different taxa that are closely related.
Closely related taxa tend to have more similar life cycles and tend to occupy more similar niches.
Categorizing different human races as &ldquo;R-selected&rdquo; or &ldquo;K-selected&rdquo; thus has some meaning, but not as much as the <a href="#human-races-patterns">improved terminology that I propose</a>.
This essay focuses mainly on comparing different human races.

<h3 id="differential-k-problems"><span class="section-number-3">4.3.</span> Differential <i>K</i> Theory Lacks Predictive And Explanatory Power</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-differential-k-problems">
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_K_theory">Differential <i>K</i> Theory</a> is an attempt to apply R/K selection theory to human races.
It proposes that the evolution of every race was affected by a &ldquo;<i>K</i> factor&rdquo;, which theoretically affects and explains multiple race differences in fertility, IQ, criminality, and sexual anatomy and behavior.
Europeans, East Asians, and other intelligent races are supposedly K-selected, while less intelligent races are supposedly R-selected.
Parental investment presumably favors quality offspring in the former, while favoring quantity in the latter.
</p>

<p>
However, Differential <i>K</i> only raises the question as to what factors affect the <i>K</i> factor.
There are no coherent answers to this question.
It&rsquo;s not clear how different <i>K</i> factors would affect the selection for intelligence in different populations around the world.
It&rsquo;s also not clear how different levels of parental investment are related to genetic differences or selection for intelligence.
</p>

<p>
Labeling a population as R-selected or K-selected is only a binary distinction.
This limits the amount of information that these terms can convey.
Not all K-selected populations are the same as each other, nor are all R-selected populations the same as each other.
For example, the R/K selection framework doesn&rsquo;t make it clear how &ldquo;K-selected&rdquo; populations like Europeans and East Asians are different from each other, nor does it describe how &ldquo;R-selected&rdquo; populations like sub-Saharan Africans and Latinos are different from each other.
R/K selection doesn&rsquo;t describe the different selectionary pressures these populations went through.
</p>

<p>
Even if the <a href="#what-is-r-k-selection">patterns associated with R-selected and K-selected species</a> seemingly map well onto some human races, it&rsquo;s still ambiguous whether some races should be classified as &ldquo;R-selected&rdquo; or &ldquo;K-selected&rdquo;.
Supposedly, K-selected races have lower fertility rates and higher average IQs.
However, fertility rates are largely dependent on environmental factors.
Fertility rates will be low if a population has large amount of birth control.
Fertility rates also drop during times of war and/or famines, and they <a href="../faqs/overpopulation#stats-more-wealth-more-children">increase during economic booms</a>.
It&rsquo;s thus not meaningful to classify populations as &ldquo;R-selected&rdquo; or &ldquo;K-selected&rdquo; based on their fertility rates.
Even if a population has a relatively higher average IQ, it&rsquo;s more descriptive and straight-forward to simply say that instead.
</p>


<p>
Differential <i>K</i> Theory is popular among many <a href="../faqs/race#not-racists">race idealists</a>, since it justifies their ideology.
The race idealists want to believe in R/K selection theory because it provides a narrative for explaining why some races have higher or lower intelligence and others.
The truth is actually more complex, and it probably doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with different levels of parental investment.

All populations evolved to live near the carrying capacities of their respective environments, <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/01/rk-selection-theory-is-bogus.html">not just &ldquo;K-selected&rdquo; populations</a>.
It&rsquo;s thus more descriptive to describe every population by the main factor that had historically kept them below the carrying capacities of their respective environments.
</p>

<p>
As mentioned in &ldquo;<a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html">Life is Violent</a>&rdquo;, human populations have historically been limited by a combination of disease, famine, and war.
All human populations are known to have dealt with these causes of death at one point or another in their histories, but most populations were affected by each of these factors to different degrees.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
War is not an alternative to peace and prosperity.
War is an alternative to famine and disease, and famine almost always leads to war.
If you and your children are facing death by starvation, then you will kill other people to get food.
So, unless disease kills most children before adulthood, population growth will eventually lead to war.
That is why war is a human universal.
Our ancestors fought to survive.
We inherited the genes and memes of the winners, not the losers.

For recent human history, it&rsquo;s accurate to make some generalizations about human populations:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Eurasian populations were mainly limited by diseases.</li>
<li>South Asian populations were more limited by famines and malnutrition, in the past few hundred years.</li>
<li>Amerindian, Austronesian, and sub-Saharan African populations were mainly limited by famines, malnutrition, <a href="#tribal-warfare">and wars</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Words like <b>disease-resistant</b> and <b>famine-resistant</b> are thus better descriptors for summarizing and describing the adaptations of modern human populations.
However, they aren&rsquo;t the only descriptors that we can use.
We can brainstorm many other terms and statistics, such as &ldquo;shorter gestational lengths&rdquo;, &ldquo;early pubertal development&rdquo;, &ldquo;higher intelligence&rdquo;, etc.
For an information-dense continuous variable, we can graph and calculate the <a href="https://brittonicmemetics.wordpress.com/2024/10/17/brood-size/">Ancestral Premature Death Rate (APDR)</a> for every race.

<div id="outline-container-disease-resistance" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="disease-resistance"><span class="section-number-4">4.4.1.</span> Disease-Resistance</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-disease-resistance">
<p>
As it turns out, the races that are usually theorized to be &ldquo;K-selected&rdquo; (i.e. European, Jews, and East Asians) were usually limited by diseases and such.
We could describe them as <b>disease-resistant</b><sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>.
Eurasia had multiple factors that contributed to the spread and number of diseases, compared to the Americas and Africa:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Animal Domestication: Eurasia had more domesticable large mammals like cattle, pigs, sheep, and horses.
Close proximity to these animals facilitated the transmission of zoonotic diseases - illnesses that can jump from animals to humans.
Diseases like smallpox, influenza, and measles likely originated from animal populations in Eurasia.</li>
<li>Population Density and Settlements: Early agricultural societies in Eurasia developed larger, more concentrated settlements.
Dense populations living close to domesticated animals created ideal conditions for diseases to spread and mutate.</li>
<li>Geographical Connectivity: Eurasia is a large, horizontally-oriented landmass that allowed for easier migration of people, animals, and subsequently, pathogens.
This connectivity meant diseases could spread more widely and quickly compared to the more fragmented and vertically-oriented continents of the Americas and Africa.
Historically, most civilizations were horizontally shaped.
It was easier for civilizations to spread east or west than north or south since the former directions were easier for adapting to climates and growing crops.</li>
<li>Continuous Population Mixing: Trade routes like the Silk Road facilitated constant human movement across Eurasia, allowing pathogens to spread and evolve more rapidly than in more isolated regions.</li>
<li>Population Bottleneck in the Americas: The Amerindians went through a population bottleneck in a very cold area (the Beringia land bridge) before setting foot on the American continent, further reducing the amount of diseases that they carried with them.
The low population density and low temperatures both likely reduced the amount of pathogens in their population and all their descendants.</li>

<div id="outline-container-disease-civilization" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="disease-civilization"><span class="section-number-4">4.4.2.</span> Disease, Civilization, And Higher Intelligence</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-disease-civilization">
<p>
Historically, disease-resistant races built more stable civilizations, which thus enabled higher populations in the long-term.
Higher populations made it easier to spread diseases, which thus selected for disease immunity.
There was thus a feedback loop between disease prevalence and higher populations.
</p>

<p>
Diseases have the potential to decrease populations in the short-term, and they have occasionally threatened the prosperity of civilizations.
It may thus seem paradoxical to recognize the connection between disease prevalence and higher populations and civilizations, but the reasoning still stands.
By contrast, populations with a strong history of famines or wars have little historical record of building long-term complex civilizations.
This is likely because war was destructive to building thriving civilizations.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s <a href="../faqs/race#intelligence-tradeoffs">well known</a> that larger brain sizes correlate with higher intelligence.
Bigger brains and higher intelligence both correlate with higher energy consumption.
Higher energy consumption burns more calories at a faster rate, which causes lower <a href="#famine-resistance">famine-resistance</a>.
There are thus trade-offs as to whether a population becomes more intelligent versus more famine-resistant.
Famine-resistant likely selects for smaller and less intelligent brains, because they burn fewer calories.
This reaffirms the theory that the populations of the smartest races in the world were mainly limited by diseases.
</p>

<p>
Historically, increases in IQ seem to be linked to the growth of civilization: laws, money, writing, math, etc, or things that require abstract reasoning.
The causal chain of <code>Diseases -&gt; Civilization -&gt; Increased Intelligence</code> is far superior to other theories of intelligence selection and adaptation, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lynn#Race_and_national_differences_in_intelligence">Cold Winters Hypothesis</a>.
Elaborating on this topic would probably require writing another essay.
For now however, the causal chain between disease prevalence and observed intelligence offers a likely explanation for why strong disease immunity and higher intelligence often appear together in populations that have one or the other (e.g. Europeans, Jews, East Asians, etc).

<div id="outline-container-famine-resistance" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="famine-resistance"><span class="section-number-4">4.4.3.</span> Famine-Resistance</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-famine-resistance">
<p>
Human populations that were mainly limited by famines and malnutrition have been historically rare.
Usually, most human populations that were primarily limited by famines chose to fight wars to steal land, food, food-producing capital in order to limit the further starvation and malnutrition of their people.
Famine-resistant populations thus tend to have histories filled with lots of warfare.
Wars tend to destroy civilizations, which tends to reduce natural selection in favor of higher intelligence.
</p>

<p>
I thus propose that famine-resistant populations tend to only exist for short periods of time or rare circumstances, until war and/or disease become the main cause of death among the population.
When a different major cause of death becomes more prominent or prevalent for long periods of time (compared to famine), some famine-resistance traits may wither away over time, but only if the famine-resistance adaptations aren&rsquo;t adaptive in the absence of famine (being the main cause of death).

<div id="outline-container-south-asians" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="south-asians"><span class="section-number-4">4.4.4.</span> Famine-Resistance In South Asians</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-south-asians">
<p>
In recent history, South Asians are an example of a primarily famine-resistant population with a relatively low record of deaths from warfare.
South Asia had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_major_famines_in_India_during_British_rule">10-15 major famines within 200 years in the 1700-1900s</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine_in_India">Link 2</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9Y0XpdfEek">Link 3</a>).
As a consequence, South Asians evolved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9Y0XpdfEek">traits that are adaptive to surviving famines</a>, including: smaller frames, low lean muscle mass, insulin resistance, and higher body fat percentages.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.sebjenseb.net/p/most-accurate-national-iqs-possible">South Asia has some of the lowest average IQ scores</a> on the entire Eurasian continent.
This suggests that something happened to either bottleneck or reverse the selection for intelligence in South Asia, compared to the rest of the continent.
Given <a href="#disease-civilization">the aforementioned reasoning</a>, I suspect that the famines of recent history selected for smaller brains and lower intelligence among South Asians.
If this is true, then I&rsquo;d estimate that South Asia&rsquo;s IQ scores would be closer to the IQs found in Middle Eastern countries, if the South Asian famines in the past 300 years never happened.
</p>

<p>
We also have to keep in mind that the population of South Asia (and the world in general) was increasing from the 1700s to the present, due to the introduction of New World crops and technological advancements.
Since the world&rsquo;s carrying capacity rose during this time, famines and wars were less common in our timeline over the past 300+ years than they otherwise would&rsquo;ve been.
</p>

<p>
British rule probably partially caused some famines in South Asia, but its rule probably also prevented some wars in South Asia, since it had strong political authority and superior technology for settling conflicts and disputes.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-obesity-rates">
<p>
Populations that weren&rsquo;t historically limited by diseases tend to have higher obesity rates.
This makes sense, since such populations would&rsquo;ve had more deaths due to famines, which would&rsquo;ve selected for traits for surviving famines.
Traits for conserving body fat (and hence energy) more strongly can plausibly increase the probability of survival from famines.
In the presence of abundant food and the absence of famines, such traits can also increase obesity and diabetes rates.
</p>

<p>
Many Austronesian countries have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity_in_the_Pacific">highest obesity rates in the world</a>.
This can be mainly attributed to unhealthy changes in their diets, but it&rsquo;s likely that genetics and culture are also contributing factors.
</p>

<p>
In the United States, blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity_in_the_United_States#Race">have higher obesity rates</a> than whites and Asians.
While different diets are once again a contributing factor, it seems likely that blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians are probably more famine-resistant than Europeans, East Asians and Southeast Asians.

<p>
I established that human populations were <a href="#human-races-patterns">mainly limited by disease, famine, and war</a>.
I also defined <a href="#disease-resistance">disease-resistant</a> populations and <a href="#disease-resistance">famine-resistant</a> populations.
One may follow these patterns and assume that there should also be &ldquo;war-selected&rdquo; humans, or humans who evolved to survive and win wars (e.g. <a href="#tribal-warfare">American Indians</a>, sub-Saharan Africans, etc).
However, this doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a very useful distinction in practice.
Upon closer examination, there aren&rsquo;t any notable differences between &ldquo;famine-resistant&rdquo; or &ldquo;war-selected&rdquo; populations, or at least not any that I have noticed.
</p>

<p>
Either way, populations that were not mainly limited by diseases are usually what R/K selection theorists think of as being &ldquo;R-selected&rdquo;, or having fast-paced life and reproduction strategies.
&ldquo;R-selected&rdquo; human races tend to have earlier pubertal development, shorter pregnancies, higher impulsivity, and lower abstract intelligence.
Each of these traits have tradeoffs, but they would theoretically make it easier to have more children within shorter periods of time.
</p>

<p>
Even then, although R-selected humans populations have many characteristics that are associated with the concept of <a href="#what-is-r-k-selection">R-selection</a>, the differences in some of these traits aren&rsquo;t very large.
The gestational length between R-selected and K-selected races <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1521693415001613">is only about one week</a>.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>
Additionally, R-selected races only start puberty about <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23934693/">one to two years earlier</a> than the most K-selected races.
In other species however, it&rsquo;s plausible that the differences between R and K selected subspecies could be much greater.
</p>

<p>
Bigger brains generally have more neural connections and greater complexity, so it makes sense that it would take longer for them to develop both inside and outside the womb.
The relatively smaller brains of R-selected races is likely a contributing factor as to why humans from such races usually have relatively smaller gestational periods and earlier pubertal development.
However, there could be other reasons as well, which would need to be determined with further research and analysis.

This is fallacious because <a href="../pdfs/r-k-selection-theory-is-bogus.pdf">&ldquo;high density&rdquo; and &ldquo;crowdedness&rdquo; are not well-defined</a>.
R/K selection theory proposes that R-selected species evolved to live beneath the carrying capacity.
However, this is a false assumption because all organisms evolved to reproduce up to the carrying capacity, <a href="../pdfs/r-k-selection-theory-is-bogus.pdf">as mentioned before</a>.

It&rsquo;s difficult to <a href="../faqs/overpopulation#LMPL">calculate and model the carrying capacity</a> because it is usually affected by an innumerous set of factors that are nearly impossible to predict and calculate in an advance.
This confusion may cause some people to mistakenly believe that some populations never reach their carrying capacities, even when the population is exceeding what the resources of its environment can support.

In spite of the faster reproductive advantages of R-selected populations, <i>all</i> populations have the potential to grow exponentially towards infinity.

<p>
In modernity, there are abundant resources, and we can observe that sub-Saharan Africans have higher fertility rates than Europeans and East Asians.
However, Sub-Saharan Africa has far lower contraception rates than the rest of the world, so it would be inaccurate to attribute to attribute the higher total fertility rate of Africa to R-selected traits.
</p>

<p>
Birth control has the potential to drastically alter a country&rsquo;s fertility rates within short periods of time.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Japan#Vital_statistics">From 1947 to 1957</a>, Japan&rsquo;s total fertility rate dropped from 4.54 to 2.04.
As another example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_Philippines#Fertility_and_births">fertility rate in the Philippines</a> fell from 2.7 in 2017 to 1.9 in 2022.
It&rsquo;s not like the Japan and the Philippines suddenly went from being &ldquo;R-selected&rdquo; to &ldquo;K-selected&rdquo; within just 5-10 years.
That rapid change in the fertility rate is best explained by the sudden rise of birth control within the countries.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, no race would perform relatively well if they were living outside their ancestral environments <i>without</i> abundant resources.
For example, if sub-Saharan Africans were placed in pre-industrial Europe or pre-industrial East Asia where scarcity was common, they would not have higher fertility because they are not adapted to those environments.
Instead, they would have lower fertility rates than the races that are already adapted to those environments.
The same is true for K-selected races, if they were placed in environments associated with R-selected races.
</p>

<p>
The United States has abundant resources and widely accessible birth control, so it seems like an optimal environment that has eliminated the main environmental factors that might affect fertility rates.
In the United States, the R-selected races have slightly higher fertility rates than the K-selected races.

R/K-Selection Theory <a href="#r-k-theory-problems">isn&rsquo;t defined very well</a>.
The theory has multiple falsehoods and contradictions, so <a href="#what-is-r-k-selection">the patterns that it proposes</a> don&rsquo;t always apply consistently.
R/K selection also doesn&rsquo;t have very much explanatory power, since the binary distinction limits the amount of information that it can convey.
The information that R/K selection conveys can be somewhat increased by only examining subspecies of the same species and other closely related taxa.
</p>

<p>
With respect to humans, R/K selection doesn&rsquo;t explain why some races have higher intelligence than others or why some races have higher obesity rates than others.
And while R-selected races have some traits that enable faster reproduction, these differences are too small to cause noticeable population differences, especially when we consider different environments, resource abundance, and the effects of birth control.
<a href="#differential-k-problems">Differential <i>K</i> Theory fails to explain</a> the patterns that it observes because it doesn&rsquo;t describe the historical selectionary pressures of populations.

For non-human populations, it&rsquo;s plausible that some subspecies may have more noticeable different R-selected traits.
Non-human animals could also be described with different descriptors, in order to communicate the main barriers that such populations face regarding their survival and reproduction (e.g. predation-resistant).
By using better descriptors, the evolutionary reasons as to why some species and subspecies have varying intelligence and other traits than others becomes more clear.

<li>&ldquo;The Hurons as well as other Iroquoian peoples were known for the fierce ways in which they waged war against one another. Warfare between the Hurons and the Iroquois became so intense that women could not work in the fields to till their corn outside the defence of their palisades without fear of being clubbed to death on the spot and their scalps taken&#x2026;&rdquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyandot_people#War">Source</a></li>

<li>The Iroquois engaged in wars, cannibalism, slavery, and torture with other American Indians. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois">Source</a></li>
<li>&ldquo;A war party was considered successful if it took many prisoners without suffering losses in return; killing enemies was considered acceptable if necessary, but disapproved of as it reduced the number of potential captives. Taking captives were considered far more important than scalps. Additionally, war served as a way for young men to demonstrate their valor and courage. This was a prerequisite for a man to be made a chief, and it was also essential for men who wanted to marry. Haudenosaunee women admired warriors who were brave in war.&rdquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois">Source</a></li>
<li>&ldquo;The neighbors of the western Cree were Athapascans on the north and northwest, Blackfeet on the west, and Assiniboine on the south. With the Assiniboine they were closely associated from the time of the separation of that tribe from the parent Sioux prior to the opening of the country by exploration in the early years of the seventeenth century; nevertheless, there were rather frequent drunken brawls, with consequent murders, between the two tribes in the boisterous era of the fur-trade. They joined forces in pushing the Blackfeet, Bloods, and Piegan southwestward out of the plains bordering Saskatchewan river, and up to the termination of inter-tribal warfare remained constant enemies of these other Algonquians. The Cree inheritance of the historic Sioux hostility toward the Chippewa was not lessened by the friendly reception they accorded the renegade Assiniboine, for whom the Sioux entertained bitter hatred mixed with professed contempt. The Woods Cree had little, if any, part in this warfare with the Blackfeet and the Sioux; their operations were limited to dispossessing the Athapascans of their territory between the Saskatchewan and Athabasca lake. Peace river, according to Henry, received its name from the circumstance that the Cree and the Beavers settled their hostilities at Peace point. —The North American Indian, Volume 18 (1907)&rdquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Confederacy#Early_expansion_and_the_fur_trade">Source</a></li>
<li>&ldquo;Inuit had trade relations with more southern cultures; boundary disputes were common and gave rise to aggressive actions. Warfare was not uncommon among those Inuit groups with sufficient population density. Inuit such as the Nunamiut (Uummarmiut), who inhabited the Mackenzie River delta area, often engaged in warfare.

<li>&ldquo;Virtually all Inuit cultures have oral traditions of raids by other indigenous peoples, including fellow Inuit, and of taking vengeance on them in return, such as the Bloody Falls massacre. Western observers often regarded these tales as generally not entirely accurate historical accounts, but more as self-serving myths. However, evidence shows that Inuit cultures had quite accurate methods of teaching historical accounts to each new generation. In northern Canada, historically there were ethnic feuds between the Dene and the Inuit, as witnessed by Samuel Hearne in 1771.

<li>The historic accounts of violence against outsiders make it clear that there was a history of hostile contact within the Inuit cultures and with other cultures. It also makes it clear that Inuit nations existed through history, as well as confederations of such nations. The known confederations were usually formed to defend against a more prosperous, and thus stronger, nation.

<p>
There&rsquo;s not a single historical account of American Indian tribes that doesn&rsquo;t involve warfare with other tribes.
Once humans are the apex predator, unless there is a very high rate of disease, the majority of deaths will be from warfare because people who let their children die of starvation rather than going to war, be eliminated by those who fight for their children&rsquo;s survival.
It&rsquo;s not unreasonable to conclude that the high historical prevalence of American Indian wars may have selected for genes that predispose American Indian descendants to <a href="../faqs/race#crime-rates-gap">commit more crimes</a>, compared to other races.
</p>

<p>
There&rsquo;s no way to precisely calculate the actual percentages regarding the historical causes of death since we don&rsquo;t have unbiased samples of the deaths, but we can infer most deaths were from war based on these historical accounts and the biological reasoning given here.
We should also recognize that most of the academic estimates for the number of humans who have historically died from warfare are probably great underestimates because 1. war victims don&rsquo;t get nice noticeable burials, 2. less than 1% of living remains ever get fossilized, and 3. there is an ideological bias in Academia.
</p>

<p>
Some estimates of the pre-Columbian population of the Americas are between 7-10 million, and others estimate ~50 million, but whatever it was, it&rsquo;s likely that it fluctuated a lot with population booms/explosions and war busts.

But didn&rsquo;t <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conflicts_in_Europe">Europeans</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conflicts_in_Asia">Asians</a>, and other races also have deadly wars that limited their populations?
</p>

</div>
<p>
This misses the point.
We never claimed that Eurasia didn&rsquo;t have any wars.
The point is that the death tolls from most of those wars weren&rsquo;t enough to destroy or destabilize Old World civilizations.
Most of the wars listed in those Wikipedia articles occurred on local scales (not the entire continent), and weren&rsquo;t sufficient to keep the European population below the carrying capacity.
That is especially true for wars that mainly killed men, and few women and/or children.
Disease was the main factor that limited European populations.
European wars evidently weren&rsquo;t as destructive to European civilizations, as Amerindian wars were destructive to Amerindian civilizations.
</p>

<p>
There are many examples of Native American societies/civilizations that collapsed and reverted to simpler ways of life.
We don&rsquo;t really see that in Eurasia.
Political units collapse, and there were some collapses of large empires, but not the reversion to much simpler modes of existence.
e.g. the collapse of the Roman Empire didn&rsquo;t end civilization in Europe.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="org5fa0a23">
<p>
But most of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll">the deadliest wars of all time</a> occurred in Eurasia, not the Americas.
</p>

</div>
<p>
Of course, Eurasian wars had higher death tolls.
This isn&rsquo;t surprising because Eurasia had higher populations than the rest of the world for most of global human history.
It was possible for Eurasia to have deadlier wars because Eurasia had more people to kill to begin with.
Eurasia had larger human populations than the Americas because Eurasia usually had more robust civilizations that could sustain higher populations.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s thus normal for continents with stronger civilizations to have deadlier wars.
This is true, even given that wars were usually not the main cause of death in most Eurasian civilizations.
Eurasian wars were less frequent, most locations only had wars that occurred every few hundred years or so, and most Eurasian wars didn&rsquo;t usually wipe out entire civilizations or technological complexity.
By contrast, Amerindian wars tended to occur more frequently, and the biggest wars usually wiped out formerly existing Amerindian civilizations.
As far as we know, Amerindian wars tended to have lower death tolls, since the environments in the Americas had lower carrying capacities.

Reason and knowledge are not the <i>only</i> reason why humans rule the world.
If we examine other mammals like orangutans, elephants, and cetaceans, we will find that they are surprisingly intelligent.
They have demonstrated exceptional capabilities to memorize concepts, do arithmetic, communicate with humans on a limited level, demonstrate self-awareness, have emotions, organize advanced social structures, and have advanced communication.
Since advanced knowledge and reasoning skills are not limited to just only humans, it must be concluded that there are therefore other reasons why humans rule the world.

<h3 id="humans-vs-runner-ups"><span class="section-number-3">6.2.</span> Why Humans Are More Dominant Than The Runner Ups</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-humans-vs-runner-ups">
<p>
The reason why humans have risen above orangutans, elephants, cetaceans, giant pacific octopi, and other mammals/animals is that we are able to combine reason, communication/interaction, and our capable bodies/appendages better than any other organism in our world.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Humans have the best reasoning and knowledge skills in the world.</li>
<li>Humans have the most complex communication system and societies of any life known to mankind.
Human language can express infinite quantities of ideas and information.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GimCcrwYxdE">Orcas</a> and possibly some other animals are also known to have complex communication, but it&rsquo;s difficult for anyone to know how it compares to human communication.</li>
<li>Humans have the most capable appendages and anatomies in the world. Human hands can grasp tools and build many things with relative ease. By comparison, cetaceans and elephants don&rsquo;t have the same appendages or anatomies to enable them to build the same things that a human can, such as fires, wheels, shelters, compasses, aqueducts, medicine, modern computers, and all the other things humans have invented.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Humans also have long lifespans compared to other relatively intelligent species.
The giant pacific octopus is possibly the smartest of all invertebrates, but since its lifespan only lasts 3-5 years at max, it doesn&rsquo;t have much time to do the same productive work that humans can do before they die.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, intelligence is definitely the most important out of the four skills / qualities, but the other skills would both be rendered useless without the ability to reason.

<li>High Capacity to Reason (Intelligence)</li>
<li>Volition (the ability to reason implies volition)</li>
