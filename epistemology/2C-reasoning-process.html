<h2 id="intro"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Introduction To The Reasoning Process</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
Most people tend to be more familiar with the Scientific Method than the Reasoning Process since the former is taught in public schools whereas the latter is generally not. That being said, the Scientific Method isn&rsquo;t too different from the Reasoning Process since it&rsquo;s really just the Reasoning Process, but broken up into more steps and geared towards writing scientific research papers. I will state the Scientific Method process here for reference, and then I will explain each of the steps of the Reasoning Process from an epistemological point of view and show how it&rsquo;s a more general process of thinking. The Reasoning Process is the only valid source of Sensory Knowledge, knowledge of reality.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-the-scientific-method" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="the-scientific-method"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> The Scientific Method</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-the-scientific-method">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Define a question</li>
<li>Gather information and resources (observe)</li>
<li>Form an explanatory hypothesis</li>
<li>Test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data in a reproducible manner</li>
<li>Analyze the data</li>
<li>Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for a new hypothesis</li>
<li>Publish results</li>
<li>Retest (frequently done by other scientists)</li>
</ol>

<p>
The last step of the Scientific Method is to repeat the steps, because a proper Theory of Knowledge must be inductive, not deductive. Although forms of deductive reasoning exist, people are always bound to make mistakes. Making mistakes and understanding how they were made is part of learning, which is why the steps of both the Scientific Method and Reasoning Process are done recursively in a repetitive cycle.
</p>

</p>

<p>
At some point, all the Laws of Nature were originally deemed hypotheses. Until that point, people continue building confidence in them, or they lose confidence in it until they reject it.
</p>

<p>
In every field, one learns the basics, and if they go further then they can start to do research in that field. But there are some fields where doing the basics is truly much different than what an expert would be expected to do:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In mathematics, one first learns how to do math, then they move on to proving theorems and the like.</li>
<li>In computer science, one first learns how to program, then they move on to learning what computers are doing and how they work.</li>
<li>In linguistics, one first learns languages and the basics, then they start doing research and maybe they might even document languages.</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-sense-perception">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sense perception is the input data to the reasoning process. Without sense perception, it would be impossible to use reason because there would be no data to reason about.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Since reason can never be separated from sense perception, then there is no meaningful such thing as &ldquo;pure reason&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Although the senses can be invalid, this is not a problem as long as the mind can use reason to correct the sense-perception errors.</li>
<li>Fallibilism: the principle that propositions concerning empirical knowledge can be accepted even though they cannot be proved with certainty.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Is Fallibilism a valid concept?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Note: We have to establish reasoning first before we can later proclaim that the senses are the input for the reasoning process.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-concept-formation">
<p>
<a href="../epistemology/1A-knowledge-and-concepts.html#nature-of-concepts">The Nature of Concepts</a>
</p>

<p>
When false concepts are formed, this typically occurs when sensory knowledge is gained through invalid means like emotion or faith, through intellectual dishonesty (rationalizing instead of reasoning), or due to the nature of being a subject with limited knowledge and sensory experience of reality. When the latter happens, the resulting reasoning, ideas, actions can be considered rational since they follow the reasoning process, even if the results are contrary to reality, since reason has the potential to be wrong.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-assertion-of-premises" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="assertion-of-premises"><span class="section-number-3">4.3.</span> Step #3: Assertion Of Premises</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-assertion-of-premises">
<p>
A rational mind doesn&rsquo;t merely recognize facts, it knows which facts are relevant.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The assertion of premises in an argument is the assertion of propositions that the arguer believes to be true, according to their model of experience.</li>
<li>Although emotions and instincts can also count as knowledge in their appropriate contexts, they can only establish true propositions.</li>
<li>Reason is different from emotions and instincts because reason also includes the logic step, which is when logical operations are performed to connect propositions together and form new propositions (conclusions) that are true if all the premises are true.</li>
<li>That being said, any propositions generated by emotions and instincts would be included in Step #3 of the reasoning process, following Step #2 concept formation and before Step #4 logic.</li>
</ul>

<p>
See: <a href="../epistemology/2D-reasoning-skills.html#premises-properties">Properties of Premises</a> for more details on premises.
</p>

<p>
The reason why assertion of premises is a separate step from concept formation are that:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Premises can be real or hypothetical,</li>
<li>Stating premises should be the first step of making an argument,</li>
<li>Implicit premises should be stated explicitly,</li>
<li>Not all the concepts that one knows will be used in an argument, so stating the concepts that are relevant to an argument as premises helps other people understand arguments more clearly.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-logic-subprocess" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="logic-subprocess"><span class="section-number-3">4.4.</span> Step #4: The Logic Sub-Process</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-logic-subprocess">
<p>
Since premises and logic can both be used to make conclusions, those conclusions are frequently used as premises for other later arguments. So although the Logic step of the Reasoning Process is being listed here as following the Assertion of Premises step, there is often the case that there is a lot of back and forth between these two steps, but it&rsquo;s typically done subconsciously.

Rationality is more than just the absence of contradiction. It is conformance to norms of judgment/decision-making.

<p>
The more common term is &ldquo;Deductive Reasoning&rdquo;, but I prefer to say &ldquo;Deductive Logic&rdquo; instead because Induction and Deduction both occur within the Logic sub-process of the Reasoning Process.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s possible to make mistakes when doing deductive logic. You might have to try several attempts before you finally prove what you&rsquo;re trying to prove, the <i>process</i> for proving things is inductive.

Examples of Ampliative Arguments:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Although we know that it took evolution X billion years to go from eukaryotic life and multi-cellular life, and we also know that it only took X hundred million years after the Earth and the solar system formed for life to appear on Earth, this is technically only an ampliative argument that the first life on a celestial body is probably easier to form than multi-cellular life.</li>
<li>The reason why is this argument is not a deductive one is because it doesn&rsquo;t account for the possibility that this timeline actually could have been an extremely unlikely event that just happened instead of one of the more likely events.</li>
<li>If we wanted to know the truth regarding which event truly takes less time to occur than the other, we would need more data points.</li>
<li>But for now, our knowledge of life on Earth as the only known, proven life to exist in the universe is the only data point in our dataset.</li>
<li>That said, and based on our current evidence (everything that we currently know about the universe), the most reasonable and most statistically likely proposition to conclude until we have more data is that it takes significantly longer for unicellular life to become multi-cellular life, than it does for single-celled life to ever appear in the first place.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-mantras-for-using-reason">

Note: These are situations where not saying the mantras would cause the person thinking/saying the mantras to be less likely to use the reasoning skill associated with that mantra.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Use reason.</li>

<p>
The phrase &ldquo;Use reason&rdquo; for invoking the inclination to use reason to solve a problem might be considered a case where the habitual use of a mantra improves the brain&rsquo;s intelligence by elevating its ability to solve problems (in this case by habitually reminding it to do something that it otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t do)
</p>

<p>
Other similar cases that might not exactly count as mantras since their wordings can vary might be: &ldquo;Why am I thinking this?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Why is mind noticing this conspicuous instance X?&rdquo;

<h2 id="what-it-means-to-be-rational"><span class="section-number-2">8.</span> What It Means To Be Rational</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what-it-means-to-be-rational">
<p>
A lot of people will say that they are rational, but they actually don&rsquo;t know what it really means to be rational. If they don&rsquo;t have a very good theory of epistemology, they might think that being rational only means not making contradictions when the beliefs are presented as propositional logic, but rationality is far more than this.
</p>

<p>
True rationality also means understanding that <a href="../epistemology/difficult-to-change-peoples-minds.html#how-coherentism-and-belief-systems-work">knowledge is formed according to belief networks in coherentism</a>, that all knowledge is constrained by our sense perception, that beliefs do not magically come out reason, the values of subjective and therefore there is no reason to do it or not do anything.
</p>

<p>
Even for the theorems that can be proven by performative contradictions, the brain technically doesn&rsquo;t have to except the premises that lead to the contradictions, just as subjects don&rsquo;t have to exist that their objective purpose is to survive, reproduce, and have children.

Another advantage to establishing the validity of the senses and empiricism later on is that it makes this philosophy more general. Futuristic robots that use physics to create consciousnesses of their own would very conceivably have different senses than humans do, as would the hypothetical non-human life that exists on other planets do.
