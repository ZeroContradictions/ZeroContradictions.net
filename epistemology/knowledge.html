The cerebral cortex is a generic pattern-abstraction and recognition device that learns from embodied experience.
In order to learn anything, we need to observe data and detect patterns that help us understand the data.

Even though there are lots and lots of wrong philosophical positions, it is still important to know them, the arguments in favor of them, and <i>why</i> they are all wrong because this helps us to better understand the correct philosophical positions by contrast.
Due to <a href="../epistemology/difficult-to-change-minds">the nature of belief networks</a>, the only way to determine the best philosophical positions is to rigorously argue them back and forth until we inductively determine the best ones.

All knowledge originates from observing reality.
We learn about reality by sensing it, making mistakes, and learning from those mistakes.
All learning is a process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning">inductive reasoning</a>.
</p>

<p>

<h2 id="nested-definitions-of-knowledge"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> The Three Nested Definitions Of Knowledge</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-nested-definitions-of-knowledge">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
The ability to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/predict#English">predict</a> (the ability to do the reasoning process).
</p>

<p>
The most specific definition is the ability to predict, and that involves models and representations of reality.
Prediction requires representing reality.
There&rsquo;s no such thing as prediction without a model.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To forecast, foretell, or estimate an unknown event on the basis of reasoning and existing knowledge.&rdquo;
</p></li>

<li><p>
The ability to do things (procedural knowledge).
</p>

<p>
We might say he knows how to skate, he knows how to dance, he knows how to sink a 3-pointer, etc.
</p></li>

<li><p>
The ability to fit form to function (FFF) (the most general definition of knowledge).
</p>

<p>
For example, We might say the flower &ldquo;knows&rdquo; how to attract bees.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
These three things are nested in the sense that the ability to predict enables you to do things, and the ability to do things is part of this more general biological concept of fitting a form to a function.
All three of these definitions imply that any acquired knowledge under any of these three definitions is ultimately aimed at solving problem.
</p>

<p>
A fourth definition of knowledge would be descriptive knowledge, which can be used to aid the actions of doing the procedural or prediction based definitions of knowledge, although it cannot be used to solve problems by itself alone.
</p>

<p>
Related: <a href="../epistemology/representationalism#problems-with-JTB">The Problems With Justified True Belief (JTB)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Since the ability to predict implies: some sort of input<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>, concepts, and the logic process step, the ability to predict is basically the same thing as the <a href="../epistemology/reasoning-process">reasoning process</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note that there should be a further distinction of <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2018/01/views.html">sensory, emotional, and experiential knowledge (SEMEX)</a>.
</p>




<p>
Just as reason is useless in a world that is completely absent of problems, knowledge would also be useless if there are:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>No problems to solve,</li>
<li>No problems that can be solved, <i>or</i></li>
<li>No problems that the reason-endowed being wants/chooses to solve.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Criteria that problems must meet to be worth attempting to solve:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There is a problem to solve,</li>
<li>It is possible to solve the problem, and</li>
<li>Some reason-endowed being would want/choose to solve the problem.</li>

Main Article: <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/05/what-is-subjectivity.html">What is Subjectivity? - Blithering Genius</a>
</p>

<p>
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_(philosophy)">subject</a> is a being who has a unique consciousness (will and awareness) and/or unique personal experiences, or an entity that has a relationship with another entity that exists outside itself (an object).
</p>

<p>
An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)">object</a> is a philosophical term often used in contrast to the term <i>subject</i>.
A subject is an observer and an object is a thing observed.
</p>

<p>
A subject has a mind.
Something is &ldquo;subjective&rdquo; if it is mind-dependent or perspective-dependent.
Subjectivity is not random or arbitrary.
Subjectivity is a concept for describing properties of the mind, like <a href="../epistemology/knowledge">knowledge</a>, <a href="../epistemology/representationalism">truth</a>, <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/02/motivation.html">emotions</a>, <a href="../epistemology/axiology">value</a>, <a href="../epistemology/free-will">will</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness">awareness</a>, etc.
</p>

<p>
A subject can be <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2018/01/views.html">viewed</a> as both a subject <i>and</i> an object.
Philosophy and psychology are the self thinking about itself.
This is achieved by viewing <i>subjects</i> from the perspective as if they were <i>objects</i>.
</p>

<p>
The conditions of being a subject within objective reality:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Biological Desires for sustaining the subject&rsquo;s life.</li>
<li><a href="../epistemology/representationalism">Truth</a> and <a href="#knowledge-patterns-and-info">Knowledge</a> that provides only a limited scope of reality.</li>
<li><a href="../epistemology/free-will">Free Will</a> (Deterministic as an object, &ldquo;free will&rdquo; as a subject)</li>
<li>Limited lifespan with eventual mortality where all biological processes cease to continue.</li>
<li>Designed to reproduce (a consequence of evolution).</li>
</ul>

We cannot understate how important the Subject-Object Dichotomy and its implications are for forming an accurate and coherent philosophy and understanding of the world.
</p>

<p>
Note: It seems that it&rsquo;s easier to learn the subject-object dichotomy inductively rather than deductively, i.e. by learning the more specific applications, and only then looking at the big picture.

<p>
The a priori and a posteriori distinction was central to Immanuel Kant&rsquo;s entire philosophy. Kant proposed that Knowledge of Metaphysics is Synthetic, A Priori Knowledge. Metaphysics is supposed to be definition-based knowledge about the world that seeks deeper meaning.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For example, it is one thing to know that a triangle has three sides, but it&rsquo;s another thing to know that all the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, and is thus equivalent to traveling in the exact opposite direction.</li>
<li>In this example, a triangle is defined as having three sides because that is the most distinguishing characteristic that the human mind uses to define a triangle when first learning about it (distinguishing characteristics are most important for classifying and categorizing concepts).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Kant believed that the pinnacle of Metaphysics and Mathematics was to understand the world&rsquo;s less obvious characteristics, beyond its most obvious characteristics.
Metaphysics isn&rsquo;t supposed to be a bunch of empty definitional truths, metaphysics is supposed to discover truths that are necessary and universal. Metaphysics is supposed to extend our knowledge, to be ampliative.
</p>

</p>

<p>
A Priori knowledge is defined as being justified by appealing to the senses.

<li>To explain things that we don&rsquo;t understand.</li>
<li>To provide concrete descriptions of what we are talking about.</li>

<h2 id="what-is-mathematics"><span class="section-number-2">7.</span> What is Mathematics?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-what-is-mathematics">
<p>
Mathematics is a system of reasoning for number, quantity, space, and change, given a set of premises.
</p>

<p>
Mathematical foundations is &ldquo;how&rdquo;, philosophy of maths is &ldquo;why&rdquo;.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026; the sciences do not try to explain, they hardly even try to interpret, they mainly make models. By a model is meant a mathematical construct which, with the addition of certain verbal interpretations, describes observed phenomena. The justification of such a mathematical construct is solely and precisely that it is expected to work—that is, correctly to describe phenomena from a reasonably wide area &#x2013; John Von Neumann
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
When people use the term &rsquo;Mathematics&rsquo;, they usually mean at least one of three things:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Using reason, logic, theorems, and axioms to prove new theorems that can enable us to make conclusions about abstract situations, or invent new mathematical methods for doing things.</li>
<li>Modeling a situation using abstract objects.</li>
<li>Solving the abstract model of a situation, which often pertains to a real situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These three things can be summarized as: 1. creating the tools to solve a problem (theory building), 2. modeling a problem, and 3. solving a problem (problem solving).

Nowadays, we have branches of mathematics that didn&rsquo;t exist in the past that can be used to answer philosophical questions.

Philosophical Topics That Can Be Better Understood By Using Some Branch Of Applied Mathematics:
