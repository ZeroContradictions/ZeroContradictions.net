<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-classical-axioms-intro">
<p>
Logic is the study of valid reasoning. If we wish to propose a reasonable foundationalist theory of epistemology, we should start by selectively choosing logical ontologies that will yield a logical system that will work best for our purposes.
</p>

<p>
Pre-Reading: <a href="https://stateofthenihil.wordpress.com/2019/09/26/the-laws-of-logic-or-why-formal-logic-sucks/">The Laws of Logic Explained by StateOfTheNihil</a>.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;By thinking about order of discovery and understanding that we were already making arguments before having a concept of the logical laws, we can ask how this was even possible. The answer has to do with the fact that we aren’t capable of violating the laws of logic consciously.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;This inability to violate any/most of the laws is first, what allows us to rely on them prior to conceiving of the laws themselves, but is, second, what makes the laws of logic not arbitrary.&rdquo;</li>
<li>The Laws of Logic are basically patterns in cognition, suggesting that we simply think in this way when we reason.</li>

<li>The Law of Identity
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Metaphysically: &ldquo;A is A&rdquo; or &ldquo;Anything is itself.&rdquo;</li>
<li>For Propositions: &ldquo;If a proposition is true, then it is true.&rdquo;</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The Law of The Excluded Middle:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Metaphysically: &ldquo;Anything is either A or NOT<sub>A</sub>.&rdquo;</li>
<li>For Propositions: &ldquo;A proposition, such as P, is either true or false.&rdquo;</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The Law of Non-Contradiction:
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Metaphysically: &ldquo;Nothing can be both A and NOT<sub>A</sub>.&rdquo;</li>
<li>For Propositions: &ldquo;A proposition, P, can not be both true and false.&rdquo;</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>
Explained: All of our syllogisms rely on these laws - that any thing is equal to itself, that tautologies must be true, and that contradictions must be false. Classical logic holds that everything has a definite, non-contradictory nature. A metaphysical law of identity would hold that to be perceived or even exist at all it must have a definite, non-contradictory nature.
</p>

<p>
Classical Logic Operations: Logical Connectives (AND, OR, NOT), Conditional, Biconditional, Modus Ponens, &forall;, &exist;
</p>

<p>
Some people might argue that it&rsquo;s useful to have a ternary (three-value) logic that includes a third truth value in addition to just True or False called &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo;, but the reason why &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo; is generally not included in practice is because &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo; can already be expressed in classical logic as &ldquo;True or False&rdquo; (e.g. P or ~P), and it&rsquo;s possible to use multiple conditional statements that depend on whether the condition is True or False. Adding an unnecessary truth value to our logic system would add many additional logic theorems to our theory of knowledge, which we should prefer to avoid since we want our epistemology to be as parsimonious as possible.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Metaphysics&rdquo; is a rather misleading word since we can&rsquo;t escape our subjectivity, and what most people think of as &ldquo;Metaphysics&rdquo; tends to have false presuppositions in it that we can escape our subjectivity, even though this is not possible.
</p>

<h3 id="this-axiomatic-systems-advantages"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> The Advantages Of This Axiomatic System For Philosophy</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-this-axiomatic-systems-advantages">
<p>
For our theory of logic, we will choose classical logic, which has the ontologies of being a two-value logic with existential and universal quantification. If we later discover that we wish to do reasoning that will require additional ontologies like time, possibility, necessity, evidentiality, etc or different ontologies such as additional truth value (e.g. indeterminate in addition to true and false), then we can formulate a different foundationalist theory that reuses and builds upon many of the findings in our classical logic paradigm.
</p>

<p>
One of the goals of our foundationalist system is to avoid having contradictory beliefs, to the fullest extent possible, hence we want to avoid any situation where we could have a belief A and a second belief ¬A such that a contradiction of A &amp; ¬A can be formed.
Thus a good starting approach is to identify beliefs that will always be true.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Since these are the exact same axioms used for classical logic, establishing them also unlocks all the inference rules, makes classical logic possible, and enables me to use Proof by Contradiction.</li>
<li>These three axioms also have equivalents regarding reality and metaphysics, so they can be used for more than just logic and propositions.</li>
<li>These axioms are required to be able to use Proof by Contradiction, which is necessary for showing that Performative Contradictions are contradictions.</li>
<li>Unlocking the collection of all Performative Contradictions verifies several self-evident, yet important philosophical theorems.</li>
<li>I do exist, I am conscious, I am alive, I have conscious epistemic free will, I can be certain of some things, I should have values, and reason is a valid source of sensory knowledge.</li>
<li>Although the conclusions derived from the Performative Contradictions may be self-evident, proving them by Contradiction enables us to avoid relying on self-evidence for knowing that they are true.</li>
<li>This proves that reason is a valid source of knowledge. This is a big deal because not only is reason a valid source of sensory knowledge, but it&rsquo;s the <i>only</i> valid source of sensory knowledge, and we will prove that later.</li>
<li>Once reason is established, classical logic can be used in combination to strengthen our reasoning since we managed to establish it using the three axioms.</li>
<li>All of this makes a perfect epistemic foundation for learning metaphysics and epistemology in more depth.</li>
<li>And once we learn the basics, we&rsquo;ll also be able to prove that the universe is cause-and-effect and deterministic, the senses are valid, empiricism is true, learn how evolution works, identify cognitive biases and limits of knowledge, and move on to ethics and the rest of philosophy.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Once I prove all of this as well, I can use the newly established knowledge (e.g. evolution, the evolution theorems and, etc) to re-affirm all the performative contradiction theorems established here, so the structure of this theory of epistemology will ultimately be shown to follow (Empirically-Grounded) Coherentism, not Foundationalism.</li>

<div id="outline-container-self-refutation-intro" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="self-refutation-intro"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Introduction To Performative Contradictions And Self Refutation</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-self-refutation-intro">
<p>
A performative contradiction arises when the propositional content of a statement contradicts either the act of asserting it or the noncontingent presuppositions that make possible the performance of the speech act, such as occurs with &ldquo;all statements must be false&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
A Performative contradiction, also known as a performative inconsistency or performative self-contradiction, is a type of contradiction that occurs when the speaker&rsquo;s words or actions are inconsistent with their intended meaning or purpose. There are several different types of performative contradictions, including:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Performative-constative contradiction: This occurs when the speaker&rsquo;s statement or action contradicts the content of their statement or action. For example, if a person says &ldquo;I am not a liar,&rdquo; but their actions or statements demonstrate that they are lying.</li>
<li>Performative-epistemic contradiction: This occurs when the speaker&rsquo;s statement or action contradicts the speaker&rsquo;s own knowledge or beliefs. For example, if a person says &ldquo;I know this to be true,&rdquo; but their actions or statements demonstrate that they do not truly believe it to be true.</li>
<li>Performative-deontic contradiction: This occurs when the speaker&rsquo;s statement or action contradicts the speaker&rsquo;s own obligations or rights. For example, if a person says &ldquo;I promise to do this,&rdquo; but they do not follow through on their promise.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Performative-doxastic contradiction: This occurs when the speaker&rsquo;s statement or action contradicts the speaker&rsquo;s own attitudes or beliefs.</li>
<li>Performative-perlocutionary contradiction: This occurs when the speaker&rsquo;s statement or action contradicts the effect that the statement or action is intended to have. For example, if a person says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not angry,&rdquo; but their tone or body language suggests that they are indeed angry.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These types of contradictions can have different effects on the listener or audience and can be used in different ways depending on the context, such as in literature, philosophy, rhetoric, and psychology.
</p>

<p>
Self-refutation refers to the logical fallacy of a statement or argument that contradicts itself. There are several types of self-refutation, including:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Logical self-refutation: This occurs when a statement or argument contradicts its own logical structure. For example, &ldquo;This sentence is false&rdquo; is a classic example of a statement that refutes itself.</li>
<li>Semantic self-refutation: This occurs when a statement or argument contradicts its own meaning. For example, &ldquo;I always lie&rdquo; is a statement that refutes itself because if it is true, then it must be false.</li>
<li>Pragmatic self-refutation: This occurs when a statement or argument contradicts its own implications. For example, &ldquo;You cannot trust anything I say&rdquo; is a statement that refutes itself because if it is true, then it cannot be trusted.</li>
<li>Epistemological self-refutation: This occurs when a statement or argument contradicts its own method of knowledge. For example, &ldquo;All knowledge is uncertain&rdquo; is a statement that refutes itself because if it is true, then it cannot be certain.</li>
<li>Dialectical self-refutation: This occurs when a statement or argument contradicts itself in a dialogue or debate. For example, in a debate, if someone argues that all opinions are equal and then turns around and argues that their own opinion is the correct one, it would be a self-refutation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="performative-contradictions-intro"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Why Performative Contradictions Are Ideal For Building Our Framework</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-performative-contradictions-intro">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Every performative contradiction has a corresponding theorem, provided that it is a useful one.</li>
<li>Since we wish for our axioms and other assumptions to be as few as possible, we will use all the performative contradictions that we can possibly think of to form what will be called the performative contradiction (PC) theorems.</li>
<li>Theorems that can be proven using regular contradictions (contradictions where a premise does not directly contradict itself by merely uttering it by itself) are less ideal for building the first and second set of theorems for our foundationalist theory since they require more knowledge and pertain to less general concepts.</li>
<li>We have determined that using theorems generated by performative contradictions are very ideal for building a foundationalist theory for several reasons. Once they are established, they can prove (in combination with Classical Logic):
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>They reveal several important theorems that would otherwise be assumed by many philosophers as implicit premises or knowledge that is deemed to be self-evident, which we want to avoid since the revelation of a false implicit premise usually requires rethinking every epistemic conclusion that implicitly assumes that false premise.</li>
<li>Proofs by performative contradiction are formal and rigorous ways for proving statements that many people assume to be self-evident. They therefore constitute a superior proof strategy when it is possible to use them.</li>
<li>Reason is revealed to be a valid source of knowledge.</li>
<li>We have a solid foundation for better understanding the Reasoning Process and basic Reasoning Skills (more commonly known as &ldquo;Critical Thinking Skills&rdquo;).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Even if I did not have this foundationalist framework to prove all the conclusions of the performative contradictions, I would still want to accept all those conclusions anyway based on my own intuition and sense perception. The foundationalist framework helps to further verify those obvious intuitions with a rigor that is higher than intuition.</li>
<li>Note: It is perfectly possible for people to hold self-contradictory beliefs in the Empirically-Grounded Coherentism model of the Understanding of Human Knowledge as long as they don&rsquo;t realize or question the contradiction. Reason is a game that participants must agree to play. Although it might be contradictory to use reason to doubt reason, if people are tempted to doubt reason, they will still do it as long as they haven&rsquo;t realized or refuse to recognize the contradictory in doubting reason. The point here is that even if a belief is self-contradictory, it is up to the believer to realize the contradiction for themselves.</li>

<p>
When I initially came up with the idea that I could create the foundation of my philosophy using theorems proven by performative contradictions, I was leaning towards foundationalism since I used to be an Objectivist and Objectivism is a foundationalist philosophy (and <a href="../misc/what-is-objectivism">a very contradictory one</a>). At this period in my life, I was still a borderline Efilist, as I didn&rsquo;t have the philosophical understandings to know how to refute Efilism, even though Efilism opposes my biological desires and instincts. On August 2020, I realized why Ayn Rand&rsquo;s and Aristotle&rsquo;s Axioms are contradictory and poorly chosen, which motivated me to come up with this better axiomatic system in an attempt to figure out what the founding assumptions of my philosophy were. You could say that these axioms and theorems are my attempt to <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2016/07/what-is-abyss.html">Immanentize the Abyss</a>, a metaphor for the absence of a foundation for meaning, truth, and value. &ldquo;Abyss&rdquo; means bottomless pit, and the infinite regress of justification is a kind of bottomless pit.
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s be clear: Although I am using axioms to start my philosophy off, the axioms are re-verified by the rest of the philosophy, as we will see in the other webpages that I am writing in this series on  <i>Philosophical Foundations</i> _. Consider the definition of a <b>theory</b>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A theory is a set of sentences which is closed under logical implication. That is, given any subset of sentences {s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>, &#x2026;} in the theory, if sentence r is a logical consequence of {s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>, &#x2026;}, then r must also be in the theory.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Since this blog&rsquo;s philosophy and its axioms all constitute a theory, eventually, the other sentences and propositions of the philosophy will all support each other, so this philosophy is actually coherentist, even though it starts off as being presented as a foundationalist system for pedagogical purposes.

As we explore philosophy further and find other ways and reasons to prove and believe in the same things, the performative contradiction theorems will mainly function as an additional way to build coherence within our belief system.

This is a valid performative contradiction. Whether truth is subjective or objective, saying this statement contradicts itself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;(The truth is that) There is no objective truth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This is <i>not</i> a true performative contradiction since <a href="../epistemology/truth">truth is relative by definition</a>. For that reason, asserting this statement does not have to assume that propositions are objectively true.

<p>
The does not count as a performative contradiction for the same reason why there is no objective truth: morality is intrinsically perspective-dependent. Not only that, but claiming the non-existence of objective morality does not have to implicitly assume the existence of objective morality. Stating that &ldquo;nothing is objectively immoral&rdquo; is merely the statement of an objective fact.
</p>

<p>
It can be more clearly shown why there is no contradiction in this statement if we rephrase the statement with two other statements that have equivalent meaning:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;There is no objective morality.&rdquo; = &ldquo;Nothing is objectively immoral.&rdquo;
</p>

&ldquo;Nothing is objectively immoral.&rdquo; = &ldquo;All morality is relative.&rdquo;

<div id="outline-container-sense-perception-justification" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sense-perception-justification"><span class="section-number-2">7.</span> The Justification For Sense Perception</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-sense-perception-justification">
<p>
The justification for sense perception is similar to the justification for reason. Reason is the only thing that we have, so if we reject reason, then we have nothing. Likewise, if we reject empiricism and insist that we cannot trust our senses to the extent that they are not impaired or illusioned, then we don&rsquo;t have any way of receiving any other sort of input from reality.
</p>

<p>
So we don&rsquo;t exactly have a foundation for proving empiricism and sense perception (to the extent that it is valid). We have a brain, and we have senses. And we must choose to use both of them because that&rsquo;s all we have. Fortunately, <a href="../epistemology/understanding-evolution#affirmation-of-empiricism">evolutionary reasoning can also justify empiricism</a>, just as it can justify reason, which helps build coherency. It should be self-evident to anybody who rejects the existence of supernatural phenomena that sense perception is the only source of input that humans have for observing and learning about reality.

<div id="outline-container-proving-validity-of-reason" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="proving-validity-of-reason"><span class="section-number-2">8.</span> How Should We Prove The Validity Of Reason?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-proving-validity-of-reason">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A question that is worth asking is: Should reason be self-justified? (by proof by performative contradiction among other ways) Or should reason be accepted as an axiom in this foundationalist theory?</li>
<li>My intuition is that Reason can and <i>should</i> be used to justify itself because it <i>is</i> valid, but some people would still disagree and argue that reason would have to be accepted as an axiom in this foundationalist theory. Even if it is debatable whether or not the validity of reason should be included as an axiom in this foundationalist theory of epistemology, using reason to debate the inclusion of this axiom is nothing new. Many, many other mathematical theories also use reason and debates to concretely decide the axioms that lay the foundations for those theories.</li>
<li>If it should be the case that reason cannot justify itself by performative contradiction, it would also have to be the case that reason cannot be justified by any means at all. We wouldn&rsquo;t be able to justify reason using biological and evolutionary reasoning, nor could we justify reasoning by any other mental faculties (faith, emotion, imagination (relies on reasoning), intuition (relies on reasoning)) since all of them are either invalid or end up using reason indirectly in some way, nor could we even conclude that reason has to be valid since it&rsquo;s the only other possible mental faculty available that could possibly prove the validity of reason (once again, reason would have to be used to justify itself, but it was already assumed that we can&rsquo;t do this when we ruled out proof by performative contradiction).</li>
<li>Anyway, the point here was that if reason cannot justify itself as being a valid source of knowledge, much less the only one, then it is completely impossible to justify it at all, unless it is taken to be a self-evident axiom. But even then, the very act of deciding and choosing which axioms to include in a belief system is in of itself an act of using reason, which further bolsters the self-evidence that reason is valid. Although we want the total number of axioms that we assume for any foundationalist system to be as few as possible, and while I don&rsquo;t believe that it&rsquo;s necessary to assume the validity of reason as an axiom, it certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be problematic at all to do so since the validity of reason is true, self-evident, self-justifying, and wholly consistent with our epistemic theory. It ultimately comes down to personal preference regarding whether someone wants to assume the validity of reason as an axiom or prove reason by performative contradiction and other self-justifying means. All the conclusions built on top of the founding axioms and performative contradiction theorems will be the same.</li>
