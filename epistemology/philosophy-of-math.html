<p>
&ldquo;&#x2026; the sciences do not try to explain, they hardly even try to interpret, they mainly make models. By a model is meant a mathematical construct which, with the addition of certain verbal interpretations, describes observed phenomena. The justification of such a mathematical construct is solely and precisely that it is expected to work—that is, correctly to describe phenomena from a reasonably wide area&rdquo; -John Von Neumann

<h2 id="intro"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> What is Mathematics?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
Mathematics is a system of reasoning for number, quantity, space, and change, given a set of premises.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Mathematical foundations is &ldquo;how&rdquo;, philosophy of maths is &ldquo;why&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-discovered-or-invented" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="discovered-or-invented"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Is Mathematics Discovered Or Invented?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-discovered-or-invented">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Definition of discovered: To notice or realize facts about reality.</li>
<li>Definition of invented: To create something that otherwise wouldn&rsquo;t exist.</li>
<li>Reason was probably discovered then, right? It doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense to say that humans invented reason if reason was formed over hundreds of millions of years of evolution.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Or maybe it was neither discovered nor invented, just a tool granted to us that was formed by the selection of genes capable of reason over millions of years of evolution.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mathematics is discovered when humans realize (discover) that it can model existent or non-existent phenomena.</li>
<li>Mathematics is invented when humans create the methods, visuals, proofs, and notations for making it usable and understandable to their minds, in a way that makes sense to them.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This makes sense. The other universal &ldquo;hard&rdquo; sciences weren&rsquo;t invented either. They were discovered. Nobody would ever claim that humans <b>invented</b> physics because they discovered it.</li>
<li>One reason why this question matters is that if mathematics is an invention, then that implies that it isn&rsquo;t really fundamental to the universe. On the other hand, if mathematics is discovered, that implies that it is inherent to how the universe works.</li>
<li>When mathematics is applied to solve problems, it becomes applied mathematics. Applied mathematics by itself isn&rsquo;t really an invention because it is simply just pure mathematics that now has a practical application to solving problems in the real world. That being said, applied mathematics is part of the invention that applies it to solve problems, whether that be software, hardware, machinery, some sort of physical object (buildings, roads, dams, etc), or a concept that exists in the mind (natural classes of phonemes being modeled by set theory, propositional logic used in sound reasoning, etc).</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-math-discoveries-examples">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Humans discover natural numbers, invent symbols to represent them, and later invent a positional numbering system where the digits have different values according to their position within the number. They understand every number in the positional numbering system to be: digit * 10_to_the_zeroth_power + digit * 10_to_the_first_power + digit * 10_to_the_second_power, et cetera.</li>
<li>Humans discover the number pi, and invent fractions for approximating its infinite decimal places to different levels of accuracy, so that it can actually be used in mathematical calculations.</li>
<li>Humans discover calculus, invent conceptual ideas for understanding it like infinitesimal measurements, and invent notations for representing it. Eventually they invent programs that automatically differentiate and integrate functions so that they can use calculus more effectively.</li>
<li>Proofs are both inventions and discoveries. A proof discovers a previously undiscovered conclusion, and it&rsquo;s also an invention because it enables humans to understand why the conclusion is true.</li>
<li>Humans discover linear algebra, then they invent notations for representing vectors, matrices, vector spaces, etc. They also invent the process of Gaussian Elimination for solving matrices.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To clarify, Gaussian Elimination is an invention, not a discovery. Reality doesn&rsquo;t need Gaussian Elimination to find unknown numbers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Humans discover that 2D and 3D space can be modeled using 2D and 3D coordinate systems. In reality, the axes and coordinate systems don&rsquo;t really exist since the units for both of them can be changed to whatever humans want them to be, they don&rsquo;t have any physical existence in reality, the origin can be wherever humans want it to be, etc.</li>
<li>All mathematical notations are human inventions, and some of them do work better than others. One example is how Leibniz Notation was superior for solving calculus problems compared to Newton&rsquo;s dot notation. The triangle of power is also a superior notation to logarithms, exponents, and n-roots since it connects the three concepts together in a way that is easier for humans to understand. Further evidence that notations are human inventions is that the notations never would have existed if humans never existed.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-math-and-inventions-examples">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When a new invention uses applied mathematics to solve problems, the invention and the applied mathematics are together considered to be an invention. Examples:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Airplanes, airplane engines, and the mathematics behind how they work are all collectively a new invention.</li>
<li>Cryptology software that applies number theory is an invention, but the mathematics behind how it works is not an invention alone by itself.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-colloquial-usage">
<p>
When people use the term &rsquo;Mathematics&rsquo;, they usually mean at least one of three things:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Using reason, logic, theorems, and axioms to prove new theorems that can enable us to make conclusions about abstract situations, or invent new mathematical methods for doing things.</li>
<li>Modeling a situation using abstract objects.</li>
<li>Solving the abstract model of a situation, which often pertains to a real situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In the simplistic human-centric terms, these three things can be summarized as: creating the tools to solve a problem (theory building), modeling a problem, and solving a problem (problem solving).

If one of the most important goals of mathematics is to create a medium that makes reality understandable for humans, would it be beneficial if there were standard ways to write theorems?

<p>
Since the natural language that we use for talking about mathematics is ambiguous and has multiple ways to say the same thing, it does make understanding theorems harder to some extent.

<h2 id="learn-applied-before-pure"><span class="section-number-2">10.</span> Why Applied Mathematics Should Be Learned Before Studying Pure Mathematics</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-learn-applied-before-pure">
<p>
When prioritizing what kind of math to learn first, applied mathematics should unquestionably be learned before pure mathematics for the following reasons:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Applied mathematics is guaranteed to be applicable to the real world. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be more reasonable to learn something with actual application to the real world before fathoming about theoretical ideas?</li>
<li>The more basic mathematics are applied, not pure (elaborated below).</li>
<li>Applied mathematics is a far, far smaller fraction of all of mathematics than pure mathematics is, so it&rsquo;s harder to get lost navigating it. There is potentially an infinite number of fields of pure mathematics.</li>
<li>Learning how mathematics is applied to real world applications can probably give one better ideas on how to figure out how to apply pure mathematics to real world applications.</li>
<li>Seeing the value of math in real world applications would probably motivate one to learn mathematics even further since applying mathematics is the greatest motivation for developing it and learning it in the first place.</li>
<li>Mathematics that can be connected to real world phenomena is probably easier to visualize than mathematics that don&rsquo;t have any real world applications.</li>
<li>Connecting mathematics to the real world or concepts seen before makes it more familiar, and thus easier to learn.</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-basic-and-applied-math" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="basic-and-applied-math"><span class="section-number-2">11.</span> Why &ldquo;Basic&rdquo; Mathematics Is More Likely To Be Applied Mathematics</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-basic-and-applied-math">
<p>
Interestingly, the more &ldquo;basic&rdquo; a set of mathematical knowledge is, the more likely it is to be applied instead of pure.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The best explanation for this is that &ldquo;basic&rdquo; ideas are simply more common and widespread in the real world [1].</li>
<li>And as a general rule, the earlier a set of mathematical concepts was developed, the more likely it was to be applicable to the real world (due to reason [1] stated above)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When humans were first developing mathematics, of course they had to invent the basics before brainstorming more complex ideas (since they rely on the basics first).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Perhaps part of the reason why &ldquo;basic&rdquo; ideas seem &ldquo;basic&rdquo; to us is because the ideas are in fact applicable to the real world.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>And this makes a lot of sense. If any idea was not applicable to the real world, the knee-jerk reaction would be to say that it&rsquo;s almost certainly a harder concept to understand.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Calculation of Land Rent and Land Value Tax: Calculus can be used to calculate land value if the value of the land can be approximately calculated as a gradient of value that stretches from the urban centers at the suburbs out to the rural areas, which can help illustrate why it is necessary to compensate for land rent via land value tax.</li>
</ul>
<p>
And of course, there are also all the situations where mathematics can be used to model real-world phenomenon and thus increase our understanding of them.

<h2 id="miscellaneous"><span class="section-number-2">13.</span> Miscellaneous Notes And Questions To Answer</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-miscellaneous">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Is it true that before mathematics can become applied mathematics, it must be possible to <b>model</b> natural phenomena using the mathematics?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If this is true, then being able to use mathematics to model real phenomena is always a pre-requisite to <b>doing</b> mathematics.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mathematics is not about having single, flawless proof. It&rsquo;s about trying to understand all the different facets of a topic. Having more than one proof is valuable because each offers a different perspective on the problem. It&rsquo;s also valuable to experiment, to try and break the problem, to generalize, to solve new problems, to apply the result, to be wrong.</li>
<li>What is the difference between using reason and using mathematics?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For starters, it seems that mathematics typically involves abstract concepts pertaining to number, quantity, space, and change.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>John Von Neumann is absolutely correct that science is all about making models that accurately describe phenomena in reality (which is in turn about understanding and explaining how things work). Applied science is all about using models that describe pure science to help model and solve problems that humans have.</li>
</ul>
