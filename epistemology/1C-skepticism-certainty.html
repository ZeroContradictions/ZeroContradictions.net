<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-evidence-skepticism-constraints">
<p>
Implicit in every scientific discovery and knowledge claim we ever make should be the words: &ldquo;According to all available evidence and knowledge, this is the correct conclusion&rdquo;. If you think this way, then you will welcome new findings and discoveries as a way to expand your knowledge, not as a threat to your current thoughts and dogmas. Yes, we can still be proven wrong, but we can also acknowledge this when it happens and change our beliefs to stop being wrong.
</p>


<p>
Greater evidence correlates with greater certainty, lack of evidence correlates with greater skepticism.
</p>

<p>
Simple Definition of &ldquo;Arbitrary&rdquo;: Things for which there is no evidence in believing perceptually or conceptually.
</p>

<p>
Note: It may have been asserted by some Objectivists or other philosophers that &ldquo;Arbitrary&rdquo; ideas cannot be proven wrong, but this isn&rsquo;t entirely true. Skepticism and Solipsism for example are both arbitrary ideas that can be proven wrong by performative contradiction. Likewise, if some crazy conspiracy theorist asserted that other people cannot truly know or prove if the 45th president truly did place the US under martial law, obviously such a ridiculous claim <i>can</i> be proven wrong. The same can be done for an abstract concept like &ldquo;God&rdquo; which can have many different definitions, is not observable in reality, is statistically and historically the strongest delusion to ever exist in humans, and more. Ultimately, the key to debunking the existence of &ldquo;God&rdquo; when it is defined under one of its supernatural definitions is to either keep letting the contradictions pile up until the system is rejected, and/or to question the epistemic foundations for the belief in &ldquo;God&rdquo; and the associated religion (if there is one).
</p>

<p>
More Complex Definition of &ldquo;Arbitrary&rdquo;/&ldquo;The Arbitrary&rdquo;: The absence of evidence of any sort, perceptual or conceptual. Arbitrary claims are not based on either direct observation nor any kind of theoretical argument. An arbitrary idea is a sheer assertion with no attempt to validate it or connect it to reality. Holding arbitrary ideas is just as bad as holding false ideas, because the mind has corrupted its means of objectively identifying ideas in reality and abandoned its mechanism to correct errors. The severity of how bad it is to hold arbitrary ideas depends on the extent to which an individual allows those arbitrary notions to pervade their mind.
</p>

<p>
Dictionary Definition of &ldquo;Arbitrary&rdquo;: based on random choice or personal whim, rather than any reason or system.
</p>

<p>
There is a difference between what can be inferred and what is shown to happen.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Technically, inferred events don&rsquo;t count as evidence.</li>
<li>Evidence can only consist of stuff that has concretely already happened.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Shower Thought: It would be great if English had enough evidentials to make distinctions like this more clear.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To make up for the lack of evidentials, we could invent a new terminology to distinguish between evidence and different things.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Interesting Follow-Up Note: Likewise, many humans also fall down the mistaken paths of:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>believing in arbitrary things that can never be proven,</li>
<li>considering that there is always <span class="underline">some</span> possibility that arbitrary beliefs <span class="underline">might</span> be true without any evidence, and/or</li>
<li>believing in skepticism or solipsism.</li>
</ol>
<p>
All three of these wrong paths are some of the biggest mistakes anybody could ever make when forming their implicit or explicit theory of epistemology. That being said, these arbitrary beliefs highlight the importance that we add a critical requirement / defining characteristic to our epistemological framework, and this is addressed by both the proof by performative contradiction that disproves skepticism as well as the requirement that in order for any idea to be deemed &ldquo;possible&rdquo;, it must have at least <i>some</i> evidence to back it up. Every possible concept <i>must</i> have at least some evidence to support it as a possibility.
</p>

<p>
Arbitrary statements should be treated as if nothing had been said, because no true, meaningful statements could have possibly been said if those assertions were made without using evidence, the necessary criteria that must be met before anything could be regarded as being possibly true or even certainly true.
</p>

<p>
There are various conspiracy theories circulating and false flag theories and so on. Those should always be dismissed if there&rsquo;s no evidence to support them, not because there aren&rsquo;t conspiracies, but because conspiracy theories are usually bogus.
</p>

<p>
Conspiracy Theories are almost always an excuse not to think because the conspiracy allows you to have a really bad explanation, and then just paper over the flaws in your explanation by saying: &ldquo;Well they&rsquo;re hiding it from us&rdquo;.

<h2 id="definitions-of-certainty"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> The Definitions of Certainty</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-definitions-of-certainty">
<p>
Question: Or is skepticism on a different spectrum, whereas impossibility is on the opposite end of the spectrum measuring the degree of certainty?
</p>

<p>
There are at least two different definitions of certainty:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Certainty in the sense of probability (impossible to certain, false to true), and</li>
<li>Certainty in the sense of what is unknown (what we are skeptical of) and what is certain (what we are sure of beyond a reasonable doubt).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="impossible-certainty-continuum"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> The Impossible-Certainty Continuum</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-impossible-certainty-continuum">
<p>
The Impossible-Certain Continuum: Impossible, Possible, Probable, Certain.
</p>

<p>
Question: True, False, Maybe are equivalent to Certain, Impossible, and Unknown/Possible, right?
</p>

<p>
All knowledge that we acquire within our lifetimes is based on observations by our senses, the concepts we form, and the extent to which we can infer things with logic.
</p>

<p>
The notion of &ldquo;possible&rdquo; means that &ldquo;at least some amount of evidence is available to support the idea&rdquo;. Although this can be seen as a definition and it is in fact a definition, it&rsquo;s still more than that. Believing that something is possible has large implications. When critically examined, I suppose that deeming a concept as possible can/does partially change the conception of the concept itself. It would be quite interesting if deeming something as possible vs impossible technically boils down to only a change in definition. The nature of levels/degrees/quantity of certainty, their relation to the concepts they can describe, and their relation to ontologies that comprise different types of logical systems must be further investigated.
</p>

<p>
Each of the levels of certainty: impossible, unknown, possible, likely, certain correspond to deductive, not enough information, some evidence, ampliative evidence, and deductive evidence.

<h2 id="skepticism-certainty-continuum"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> The Skepticism-Certainty Continuum</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-skepticism-certainty-continuum">
<p>
The Skepticism-Certainty Continuum: Total Skepticism / Unknown / Imaginary, Possible, Probable, Certain.
</p>

<p>
Question: How do Unknown and Imaginary Propositions fit into the Skepticism-Certainty Continuum mentioned above?
</p>

<p>
Skepticism exists on a spectrum, just like how certainty, confidence, and possibility also exist on spectrums.
</p>


<p>
The Quality of being some truth value (true/false/unknown/etc); etc = some<sub>other</sub><sub>useful</sub><sub>truth</sub><sub>value</sub> (if any)
</p>

<p>
The Probability (ranging from impossible to guaranteed or 0.00 ≤ p ≤ 1.00) of being some truth value (true/false/unknown/etc)
</p>

<p>
The Range of Skepticism to Certainty of a proposition&rsquo;s truth value, or of the probability of some proposition&rsquo;s truth value
</p>

<p>
The justifications for the truth value, the justifications for the probability, and the justifications for the range of skepticism to certainty
</p>

<p>
Note: The spectrum scales for probability and skepticism/certainty seem to blend together, especially in cases where one of the scales would not exist or would seem rather redundant.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-historical-epistemic-skepticism-analysis">
<p>
Important: Given the merits and disadvantages of skepticism, the less someone knows about the world, the more beneficial skepticism is for them. The more that someone knows about the world (and that their beliefs are lacking in contradictions / are correct), the more that skepticism becomes disadvantageous and a burden.
</p>

<p>
That being said, it is easy to see why skepticism had a fair amount of popularity as a movement in Ancient Greece. The Greeks knew very little about the world compared to what humanity knows today, and many of the Greeks beliefs were later proven to be incorrect (e.g. their polytheistic religion, creationism, they believed the world was made out of earth, fire, water, and air (and later aether). Additionally, elementary algebra, calculus, and many other mathematical fields were not discovered yet, and lots of other knowledge wasn&rsquo;t known either). If people know very little about the world, skepticism seems to be a much more practical philosophical position, whereas there are few philosophical skeptics in today&rsquo;s world.

<h3 id="functioning-as-indirect-skeptic"><span class="section-number-3">6.1.</span> Carneades&rsquo; Thoughts And Ideas On How Indirect Skeptics Could Still Function In The World And Make Arguments Without Beliefs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-functioning-as-indirect-skeptic">
<p>
The indirect skeptic needs some way to act because they can&rsquo;t suspend action. Even though they can suspend belief that is not based on beliefs because they don&rsquo;t have beliefs. Let&rsquo;s see what we can do. Well belief is something like a propositional attitude.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s called a propositional attitude that is to say that we feel a certain way towards a particular proposition in the case of belief we accept a particular proposition as true however belief is not the only propositional attitude that is open to us we can desire that a proposition is true or hope that a proposition is true we can wonder if a proposition is true or consider that a proposition is true we can suspect that a proposition is true when we can doubt that it is a skeptic can hold any of these other propositional attitudes. Philosophy doesn&rsquo;t like to talk about them, and philosophy definitely biases Belief over any other propositional attitude, but there&rsquo;s a lot more out there and you can get by in life with desire, wonder, and doubt alone.
</p>

But if you want something more specific, let&rsquo;s take a look. You could have a proclivity well a skeptic does not have beliefs they may or may not have proclivities in this.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m going to define subject S has a proclivity to act in accordance with P if and only if s generally acts as if P the case they don&rsquo;t believe it but they act as if P were the case s is a proclivity acts in accordance with P will be represented as PC s p s&#x2013; take a look so for example if a car is approaching a skeptic they may lack the belief that either they or the car exists but they have a proclivity to act as if they do they may have a proclivity to act as if cars exist and they exist and they don&rsquo;t want to get hit by a car and they don&rsquo;t want to die they have a proclivity to act as if these beliefs were true however it they don&rsquo;t accept them as true and they don&rsquo;t believe them if the skeptic jumps out of the way it&rsquo;s not because of a specific thought process of wow I believe that a car is moving towards me I believe that a car was going to hit me if I don&rsquo;t move I believe that I exist and the car exists and the car is made of physical objects I believe that I don&rsquo;t want to get hit by a car I believe that if I don&rsquo;t want to get hit by a car I should jump out of the way wow I should jump out of the way they don&rsquo;t have that very logical line of thought process it&rsquo;s just a proclivity that they have to act in a certain way in the same way that honestly most people they suddenly turned around and saw a car rushing at them would not go through that long thought process they would not think in such propositional terms they would not believe things at all they would just jump out of the way.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s the same way that if someone were to put a bowl of delicious food in front of me while I was intensely involved in watching a video or talking to someone I would not form the belief I am hungry I should eat I am going to reach my hand down in this bowl of food and start eating it I would just act that way you can act without beliefs animals that are unable to form propositional attitudes because they don&rsquo;t speak languages and you need a language to have a proposition act and take actions we can act without belief proclivity is just one way of codifying that there&rsquo;s many other explanations for it basically the skeptic merely has a proclivity to act in accordance with the claim I should avoid fast moving objects.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-skepticism-non-partisan-POV">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If even Pyrrhonic skepticists and academic skepticists still make statements indicating that to an extent, they do follow phenomenology (they don&rsquo;t have to say the word directly, even assigning probabilities or some temporary validity, or whatever they do counts), then there are fewer differences between some variations of skepticism and the rules regarding certainty outlined by Ayn Rand and followed by myself (with a few extra measures on top of Rand&rsquo;s).</li>
<li>So which epistemic theory is better than the other, if any? My combination of empirically-grounded coherentism, foundationalism based on performative contradictions, and standards for certainty, probability, and arbitrary seems to be the best to me, but I am open to constantly finding new ways to improve it, whatever those might be.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-alleged-impossibility-of-LNC">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As is true of all axioms of logic, the law of non-contradiction is alleged to be neither verifiable nor falsifiable, on the grounds that any proof or disproof must use the law itself prior to reaching the conclusion. In other words, in order to verify or falsify the laws of logic one must resort to logic as a weapon, an act which would essentially be self-defeating.[25] Since the early 20th century, certain logicians have proposed logics that deny the validity of the law.</li>
<li>Logics known as &ldquo;paraconsistent&rdquo; are inconsistency-tolerant logics in that there, from P together with ¬P, it doesn&rsquo;t imply that any proposition follows. Nevertheless, not all paraconsistent logics deny the law of non-contradiction and some such logics even prove it.</li>
<li>Some, such as David Lewis, have objected to paraconsistent logic on the ground that it is simply impossible for a statement and its negation to be jointly true.[26][full citation needed] A related objection is that &ldquo;negation&rdquo; in paraconsistent logic is not really negation; it is merely a subcontrary-forming operator.[27][full citation needed][28][full citation needed]</li>
