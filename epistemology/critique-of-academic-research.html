<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-expanding-BGs-essay">
<p>
While I like Blithering Genius&rsquo;s Essay, <i>Why Most Academic Research is Fake</i>, I personally feel that there&rsquo;s multiple important ideas that are missing from that essay, so the goal of this webpage is to expand on that topic.
</p>

<p>
NOTE: This webpage is a work in progress. It takes time to write stuff.
</p>

<p>
On my economics webpage,  <a href="../civilization/economics#planned-obsolescence">I identified multiple different types of planned obsolescence</a>.
One of them is Academic Planned Obsolescence, which is when academics dismiss the best solutions to the world&rsquo;s problems and questions, in favor of fabricating fake ideas or less efficient ideas.
The intention is to create an ever-lasting flow of academic research for them to publish, to satisfy the artificially high demand for research papers.
For example, some academics might dismiss <a href="../civilization/georgism-crash-course">Georgism</a>, so they can create dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of papers that endlessly speculate on the best taxation policy(ies) that society should use.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
As another example, some academics might dismiss <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs">race realism</a>, so that they can postulate about an endless number of hazily conceivable environmental and societal factors for why racial disparities exist.
In both cases and many others, the best answers to the questions at hand are actually straight-forward.
But if the academics were to ever expose the correct answers, they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to continuously wonder, speculate, and write about innumerous hypothetical &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; to the questions.
In such a scenario, there would be no more research papers to write, and that could be the end of many academics&rsquo; careers.
This is similar to the joke in the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Restaurant_at_the_End_of_the_Universe">Restaurant at the End of the Universe</a></i>, where there&rsquo;s a conspiracy by Gag Halfrunt and a group of psychiatrists to prevent everyone from discovering the Ultimate Question to the Life, Universe, and Everything, since it would be the end of their profession.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis">The replication crisis</a> is real in science.
But it&rsquo;s arguably less of an issue in computing science (minus the theoretical part), because computing scientists must always submit their code with the paper.
So you can run the code and get the same results as the author.
Hence, it&rsquo;s easy to replicate results in computing science.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tSqSMOyNFE">Regression to the Mean</a>;
What Regression to the Mean is, and how many statistical studies don&rsquo;t account for it, thus contributing to the abundance of fake academic research.
</p>


<p>
<a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/07/fake-news.html">The methods used to create fake news</a> are also often used to create fake research.
The establishment media rarely tell outright lies, but they often lie by selecting facts, images, interpretations, etc. to fit a preconceived narrative.
The narrative comes first, and everything else is cherry-picked to fit the narrative.
The process for writing academic papers often works similarly.
If an academic already has a conclusion that they want to present, they may ignore everything else that should also be considered and/or rig the methodology to achieve the desired results.

</p>



<p>
There is a conflict between college rankings and intellectually-honest research.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQWlnTyOSig&amp;t=418s">College rankings are complete and utter garbage</a> (the same goes for basically all &ldquo;best of&rdquo; rankings in general).
Citations per faculty is a terrible proxy for quality.
The number of academic publications a school produces has almost nothing to do with the undergraduate experience.
In fact, colleges that spend more time on research tend to place less emphasis on teaching.
When folks reminisce about college, they mention things like the fun social environment and maybe one or two stand-out classes.
What they don&rsquo;t tend to remember is their school&rsquo;s number of academic citations.
Silly as this sounds, millions of students inadvertently choose schools based on this very criteria.
All college rankings really do is reward those willing to play the game.
And that&rsquo;s of course assuming the research being cited is even good.
</p>



<p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPDK7cO-JPs">The Negative Effects Academia has had on Society</a>;
WhatIfAltHist describes how blind obedience to corrupt, partisan academics has held society back.
</p>


<p>
Another criticism that I have about Academia is that lots of Academics don&rsquo;t know how to write their papers in a manner that&rsquo;s easily read by others.
One of the reasons why Blithering Genius&rsquo;s content is so amazing is precisely because it&rsquo;s written as clearly and as articulately as humanly possible, with little to no rhetorical or metaphorical language.
This is something that seemingly most people are unable to do to some degree.
</p>


<p>
Lastly, <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/01/are-we-running-out-of-ideas.html">humans have likely passed Peak Idea Production</a>.
This is yet another reason why the growth of factual Academic Research has slowed down significantly over the last half century.
Since the supply of good ideas to discover is finite, ever-lasting academic progress is impossible.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It&rsquo;s not true that researchers are always trying to confirm research.
If you get to challenge a paper, then this can prove to be one of the best things for your career, period.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That still doesn&rsquo;t mean that challenging existing papers is likely to produce more factual research.
If anything, challenging solid and widely accepted papers just for the sake of doing so or for career advancement is likely to generate even more academic nonsense.

<div id="outline-container-fake-research" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="fake-research"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> Fake Research, And What Counts As &ldquo;Fake&rdquo;</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-fake-research">
<p>
Before proceeding, we have to clarify that labeling anything as &ldquo;fake&rdquo; is a truth judgment that depends on a <a href="../epistemology/difficult-to-change-minds#how-coherentism-works">person&rsquo;s belief network</a>.
What one person considers to be &ldquo;fake&rdquo; is not what someone else will consider to be &ldquo;fake&rdquo;.
Compiling a list of examples of &ldquo;fake research&rdquo; is thus subjective, but we shall create our list nonetheless, and give links and reasons as to why we deemed the following concepts to be &ldquo;fake&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
Sources are important for data, but I&rsquo;m usually not presenting much data in my essays.
I&rsquo;m mostly stating and explaining logically derived facts about causality and such.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-other-types-of-bad-research" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="other-types-of-bad-research"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> Other Types Of Unproductive Research</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-other-types-of-bad-research">
<p>
Fake research isn&rsquo;t the only type of bad research in Academia.
Sometimes, research isn&rsquo;t necessarily fake, but it&rsquo;s still useless or unproductive in some way.
Hence, it may be the case that the remaining ~40% of research in Academia is not fake, but it still doesn&rsquo;t really improve society or humanity&rsquo;s knowledge in any significant way.
It&rsquo;s important that we recognize and identify these types of research when evaluating Academia and its role in society.
If much of Academia is focused on producing unproductive research, then that ought to be considered a waste of economic resources.
</p>

<p>
There is a lot of overlap between these types of unproductive research, but it&rsquo;s still worth describing each of them, since they don&rsquo;t always overlap.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-redundant-and-outdated-research" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="redundant-and-outdated-research"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.1.</span> Redundant Research</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-redundant-and-outdated-research">
<p>
Redundant Research isn&rsquo;t necessarily fake, but it just replicates or draws on research that has already been published before.
</p>

<p>
Examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A linguist creates a thesis paper and poster showing the application of a linguistic phenomenon, even though there&rsquo;s already many papers out there like it before.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-plagiarized-research" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="plagiarized-research"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.2.</span> Plagiarized Research</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-plagiarized-research">
<p>
Plagiarized research is another serious problem in Academia.
It could be considered a sub-category of redundant research.
One study showed that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.22656">Wikipedia has a tendency to shape the language in science papers</a>.
</p>

<p>
In <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdBsuxr0vlc">How Widespread Is Plagiarism in Academia?</a></i>, one academic estimates that 7-9% of all PhD dissertations are plagiarized, although it may vary by the field of study.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-out-dated-research" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="out-dated-research"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.3.</span> Out-Dated Research</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-out-dated-research">
<p>
Out-dated research is closely related with redundant research in a sense, but still different.
Outdated research is often useless, compared to newer and more innovative methods.
</p>

<p>
This is also kind of depends on what gets considered &ldquo;outdated&rdquo;.
Like, optimality theory could be considered just a simpler method for modeling language phonology, not necessarily a completely outdated way of thinking about it, although it is definitely less sophisticated and less accurate.
</p>

<p>
Examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One linguist&rsquo;s PhD dissertation used stochastic optimality, but it was outdated by maximum entropy phonotactics just a few years later.</li>
<li>How one person&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s thesis studied belief networks, but it was outdated by large language models just a couple of decades later.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-useless-research" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="useless-research"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.4.</span> Useless Research</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-useless-research">
<p>
Useless Research is characterized by being undiscovered or uninvestigated (hence it&rsquo;s not redundant or out-dated), but it still doesn&rsquo;t improve human society by and large in any conceivable way.
</p>

<p>
One could make the argument that much of the research that falls into this category may have a theoretical and yet undiscovered application that could benefit humanity in the future, but that&rsquo;s unlikely to be true for many things.
</p>

<p>
Examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The linguistics professor who has published 10+ papers studying how American and Canadian hockey players affect each others&rsquo; dialects.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

The denial of the biological validity of race is an exclusively Western phenomena, biologists are less likely to deny race than anthropologists, and the global scientific consensus is overwhelmingly opposed to race-denialism. A lot of fake research occurs in the West due to the denial of biological realities.

<h2 id="WTC-controlled-demolition-reasons"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Reasons Why The Collapse Of The World Trade Center Was A Controlled Demolition</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-WTC-controlled-demolition-reasons">
<p>
There are a lot of crazy and ridiculous conspiracy theories about there about what caused 9/11, but the most sane one is the one that bases its judgements completely off of physics and nothing else.
</p>

<p>
The evidence is abundantly clear that the collapses of WTC 1, WTC 2, and WTC 7 on 2001 September 11 were all caused by controlled demolitions.
I don&rsquo;t deny that the 5 planes were hijacked on 911, and I recognize that all the destruction at the Pentagon was completely caused by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_77">American Airlines Flight 77</a> crashing into the building.
But it&rsquo;s physically impossible for WTC 1, 2, and 7 to have collapsed the way that they did solely by the plane crashes, fires, and gravity.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>WTC 1, WTC 2, and WTC 7 all collapsed with free fall acceleration, which is not physically possible for a fire and gravity collapse.</li>
<li>A fire collapse would actually look like this: eeeeeeeeeeeeeee.</li>
<li>A gravity collapse would actually look something like this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfside_condominium_collapse">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfside_condominium_collapse</a>.</li>
<li>There are no skyscrapers that are known to have collapsed due to fire and/or gravity. WTC 1, WTC 2, and WTC 7 are the only skyscrapers that are claimed to have collapsed solely due to fire and/or gravity, and even this is dubious.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not possible for fire and jet fuel to have caused an explosion at the top of the tower(s), as shown in the videos.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1945_Empire_State_Building_B-25_crash">A plane once accidentally crashed into the Empire State Building in 1945</a> and caused a huge fire, but that wasn&rsquo;t enough to make the Empire State Building collapse.</li>

<li>WTC 7 didn&rsquo;t even have a plane crash into it, and it still collapsed with free fall acceleration.</li>
<li>There was no jolt when the highest level of the tower first fell down.</li>

<li>The steel spire was still left standing after all the floors around it collapsed with free fall acceleration.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>By Newton&rsquo;s Laws of Motion, if there was enough force to cause the floors to collapse, then it had to have been strong enough to make the steel spire collapse as well, but it wasn&rsquo;t.</li>
<li>Instead, the steel spire stayed standing for 10-15 seconds (as captured by multiple videos), before its bottom got cut somehow, and then it fell like a chopped falling tree.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Even if extremely hot steel can still remain both solid <i>and</i> flexible, it&rsquo;s still not possible for said steel to have become weak enough to cause the buildings to collapse with free fall acceleration.</li>

<li>There was nano-thermite found in the debris, which is military-grade explosive material.</li>
<li>There were small iron spheres found in the debris, which could&rsquo;ve only been created from the result of an explosion.</li>
<li>There was eutectic steel with Swiss cheese holes found in the rubble, which could&rsquo;ve only been created from the result of an explosion.</li>
<li>Jet fuel cannot burn hot enough to melt steel, yet there was still melted steel found at the ground zero site.</li>
<li>Ground Zero remained hot for <i>days</i> after the towers collapsed, which is not possible for a fire and gravity collapse.</li>
<li>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) removed the phrase &ldquo;EEEEEEEEEEEE physically possible&rdquo; from their final report on how the towers collapsed, which means that they&rsquo;ve implicitly acknowledged that the government-backed theory for the towers collapsing is not physically possible.</li>
<li>Since the government has removed this phrase, and they have no plans to investigate it any further, this suggests that some kind of Deep State is responsible for the destruction of the World Trade Center. If they weren&rsquo;t responsible for destroying the skyscrapers, then why aren&rsquo;t they interested in creating physically feasible descriptions for how the buildings collapsed? The most likely reason is that some government figure or connection to the US government is responsible for the destruction.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>i</li>
<li>i</li>
<li>The 9/11 controlled demolitions has to be the most impressive stunt ever pulled off by the deep state.
They managed to totally level three buildings in the most populated city in America by precisely preparing explosives while they were occupied, and trick most of the population into thinking plane crashes were enough to cause it.</li>
<li>This will have seriously negative geopolitical implications (for the US) if we expose the lie. If the American people can&rsquo;t trust their own government (as cliche as that sounds), then every country around the world will spring to the opportunity to use this as an excuse for why they can&rsquo;t trust the US government either, even if/when they do the right thing(s).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There is reason to believe why exposing this lie would shift the balance of power. To a great extent, there are a lot of open lies in geopolitics that everybody knows about, but there are serious consequences if people say them out loud.</li>
<li>For example, China knows that the US and Taiwan don&rsquo;t support China annexing or reunifying with Taiwan, but if either Taiwan or the US said that out loud, then China would start invading Taiwan ASAP in order to defend their territorial claims.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s complicated, but that&rsquo;s just how geopolitics works. Lies can&rsquo;t be universally accepted as lies unless the key adversaries involved admit/acknowledge them.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If we exclude the number of deaths and casualties caused by the controlled demolitions on 9/11 from the US government reported number of deaths and casualties, then the total number of people who died on 9/11 solely from the terrorist attacks would only be everybody on the five hijacked flights, and the people who died from AA flight 77 crashing into the Pentagon. That would be less than 400 people.
This would thus make the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor">1941 Attack on Pearl Harbor</a> the deadliest attack on American soil that was caused by a <i>foreign</i> entity. There&rsquo;s even some evidence to suggest that US intelligence knew about the attack on Pearl Harbor was going to happen before the Japanese military attacked it, which would imply that the first two or three deadliest attacks on American soil were all known about by the US government to some extent beforehand.</li>
<li>Since all the deaths caused on 9/11 were caused by two separate causes (1. plane hijacking and crashes, and 2. controlled demolitions), we should separate everything that happened on that day (the causalities, events, timeline, etc) into two separate categories.</li>
<li>If WTC 1, 2, and 7 were all destroyed by controlled demolitions <i>and</i> WTC 1 and WTC 2 were struck by planes before they were blown up, then the controlled demolitions had to have been timed so that the towers would blow up <i>after</i> the planes crashed into the towers. This means that whoever blew up the towers <i>knew</i> that the planes were going to eventually crash into them, and they timed the controlled demolitions so that the plane crashes would seem to what caused the destruction of the towers to the public.</li>
<li>i</li>
<li>i</li>
<li>i</li>
<li>i</li>
<li>i</li>
</ul>

<p>
The 9/11 Truth Movement has uncovered overwhelming evidence that the destruction of the World Trade Center was a crime that required:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Long-term inside access to the buildings.</li>
<li>Access to military-grade demolition materials.</li>
<li>The ability to coordinate the demolitions with the hijacker scenario.</li>
<li>The elaborately staged fumbling of what should have been routine interceptions.</li>
<li>A massive cover-up that began on the day of 9/11.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Augustine&rsquo;s Amazing Commentary
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>How did they installed explosives and thermite cutting charges in the building over the course of at least a month while it was occupied with over a thousand people.</li>
<li>That was definitely the most difficult task. Everything else was fairly easy by comparison and really difficult to stop because it happened so quickly and the public didn&rsquo;t have time to react.</li>
<li>But there was plenty of time to discover bombs in the towers.</li>
<li>I bet that a large percentage if not all of the security staff were agents.</li>
<li>Maybe the fourth plane was intended to hit WTC7 but it didn&rsquo;t make it.</li>
<li>I vaguely remember a testimony from one of the former tower occupants that leading up to the attacks they remember an unusual amount of supplies being hauled around by people who looked like engineers. I can&rsquo;t remember where I found that.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It&rsquo;s probably not a coincidence that 9/11 occurred about ~10 years after the Cold War ended.
Ever since the Cold War ended, US military spending had been declining.
Given that the Military Industrial Complex has conflicts of interest and likely has strong ties to the US deep state, there&rsquo;s reason to believe that the US Military Industrial Complex blew up the World Trade Center in order to create a false flag operation and excuse for starting new wars in the Middle East, in an effort to boost declining US military spending.

<p>
There were definitely multiple agencies that were complicit with the plot.
It benefited the MIC, Israel, many corrupt politicians, and even the owner of the Twin Towers: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6ahJ9bZyYg">Larry Silverstein Earned [4 And A Half Billion Dollars] From Insurance</a>

<p>
And the US intelligence agencies because it was used as a justification for The Patriot Act.
The members of congress that were opposed to the bill <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_anthrax_attacks">were assassinated by anthrax</a>.
I&rsquo;m not sure if this is true yet but it is definitely possible.

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Osama_bin_Laden_video">2004 Osama bin Laden video</a> was probably staged, given its lateness following the 9/11 attacks, and how it was somehow timed to be released just before the 2004 US Presidential Election.

How did the explosives get into the Twin Towers in the first place?
Is there any video footage showing people bringing all the explosive materials into the buildings?

<p>
It&rsquo;s crazy how the New World Trade Center Tower is designed to supposedly be impossible to destroy, even though the original WTC towers were actually destroyed by controlled demolitions.

There only one true fire-gravity collapse that I know of is a building in Brazil that was probably much weaker than the Twin Towers.
It had to be completely engulfed in flames before it finally collapsed.
In the case of the Twin Towered it happened far to quickly and with far too many discrepancies to be purely a fire-gravity collapse.

9/11 was a premeditated shock and awe event that was instrumental in a larger plan.
It allowed the administration to immobilize the population through fear and manipulate their outrage displaced toward the designated enemy.
9/11 provided cover for a protracted attack on our democratic values and an orgy of outrageous national behavior that defined the entire Bush administration, much of which continues today.
9/11 brought us the fiction of &ldquo;preemptive&rdquo; wars as a fig leaf for naked military aggression, the fiction of &ldquo;illegal enemy combatants,&rdquo; to pretend the Geneva Conventions did not apply, and the fiction of &ldquo;enhanced interrogation&rdquo; as though that were any different from torture pure and simple.
It brought us routine drone assassinations, the expansion of secrecy, the unleashing of the NSA to conduct universal surveillance, the destruction of nearly every one of our civil liberties, attacks on journalism and the murder of journalists, paranoid fear of immigrants in general and Arabs in particular, and the demonization of Islam as a uniquely violent religion.
This list is far from complete.
