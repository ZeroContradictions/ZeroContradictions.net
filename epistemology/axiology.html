<h2 id="intro"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> What Are Values?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiology">Axiology</a> is the philosophical study of value.
Values are both goals that we strive to keep, and judgments about what is &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; from a given perspective, and they can be positive or negative accordingly.
They are typically generated from <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/02/motivation.html">motivation</a>.
Every value must have an undesirable alternative, and a desirable alternative worth striving for, lest it would cease to be a value since there&rsquo;s no point in positively or negatively valuing some aspect of reality that a subject has no choice over.
</p>

<p>
Value judgments concerning material objective things are both positive <i>and</i> negative.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Unlike truth, value is not convergent for similar brains.
Tom and Joe could have identical brains, but make very different value judgments from their perspectives.
For example, suppose that Joe and Tom both want to date Sally.
Their value judgments are identical in one way, but opposite in another way.
Joe positively values Joe dating Sally, and negatively values Tom dating Sally.
Tom positively values Tom dating Sally, and negatively values Joe dating Sally.
&#x2013; Blithering Genius, from <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/05/what-is-subjectivity.html">What is Subjectivity?</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In such cases, <a href="../FAQs/post-overton-FAQs#when-life-becomes-zero-sum">all of the linked examples</a> are potential scenarios where people have differing positive and negative value judgments between who gets what. In many cases when this happens, the <a href="../civilization/georgism-crash-course#space-utility-optimization-principle">Space Utility Optimization Principle (SUOP)</a> applies.
</p>

<p>
Values by themselves are not irrational, but when forming any general theory<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> of value, there are various ways how said theory<sup><a id="fnr.1.100" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> may rational or irrational:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It could generate two conflicting value judgments, i.e. a contradiction.</li>
<li>It could have false or unquestioned assumptions.</li>
<li>It could be justified by fallacious reasoning.</li>
<li>It could generate no value judgments at all, in which case it would be empirically vacuous, like a scientific theory that makes no predictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>
A value can be self-affirming <i>after</i> you have it, but one cannot judge a value without a value. Hence, people tend to have <i>theories</i><sup><a id="fnr.1.100" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> of value, where each of the values that they esteem each imply each other. Also note that &ldquo;set of values&rdquo; is typically less precise that &ldquo;theory of value(s)&rdquo;, since all the values within a set of values don&rsquo;t necessarily have to affirm each other. Additionally, rationality is more than the absence of contradictions. It is conformance to norms of judgment/decision-making. Likewise, values are about projecting what we want to become true onto the real world, that is how we want to change objective reality. Values are about making what we want to be true to become true in the real world.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontology">deontological</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism">consequentialist</a> ethics dichotomy conflates intent with consequences. All ethical arguments are inevitably derived from appealing to the consequences, since values cannot be judged without a pre-existing framework of values. Whether a value is &ldquo;good&rdquo; or not depends on other values, so ultimately the judgment of each of the values in the framework must appeal to the consequences of whether or not the values each support each other. This is consistent with how consequentialism is <a href="../epistemology/free-will#accountability-for-actions">the justification for why people should be held accountable for their actions from a deterministic perspective</a>.
</p>


<p>
Intrinsic Value is defined as valuing something for its own sake. Anything that has intrinsic value would have value as a property of its being, so intrinsic value is effectively the same thing as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(philosophy)">objective</a> value. We&rsquo;ve already established that value is perspective-dependent and cannot be judged without other values to judge them by, so intrinsic value doesn&rsquo;t exist. Ergo, the traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_and_intrinsic_value">instrumental and intrinsic value dichotomy</a> isn&rsquo;t a real dichotomy and it&rsquo;s not philosophically useful for categorizing values at all.

<div id="outline-container-judging-value" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="judging-value"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Judging, Ranking, And Comparing Value</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-judging-value">
<p>
All the values within a theory of value can be organized as a hierarchy of values. Since the justification for every value depends on the judgment of other values, that implies that there is no single value that stands at the top of the value hierarchy by itself, but rather there is a set of most important values, which all imply each other, and which also imply all of the subsequent lower levels of value that are each derived from the higher level values.
</p>

<p>
Visually mapping values as a hierarchy of values is useful because it more clearly shows up which values have greater importance to us than others. Value hierarchies are also helpful for identifying core values, which are important to identify since the change in one core value can change all the other values that are instrumental to achieving it. The value hierarchy can be modeled by a graph known in discrete mathematics as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">directed graph</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note: If I ever have the time to add more content to this post, I will create some directed graphs for modeling theories and hierarchies of value.
</p>

<p>
It is generally nonsensical and impractical to quantify the value for things, people, memories, etc by numbers, except in the case of prices within a market economy. Generally speaking, value in one object or another can only be ranked on a scale with other objects, and the value of different objects can be compared against each other of course. Almost no one (maybe even everyone) would value all their possessions according to weighted ranks, although whole number or even integer ranks are reasonable. And it does get harder and harder to rank every item in one&rsquo;s possessions for ever, to the point where doing so would become pointless at some, especially for the least important items a person owns. Even though there are no good evolutionary reasons to rank the objects in one&rsquo;s possessions with a continuum of real numbers, it does make perfect sense to rank things relative to other things, based on how much we need / like / want things that we may or may not have. The reason why currency becomes necessary to compare the values of many different things is because the additional complexity is needed in order to replace the bartering system, especially since prices are based on how the community (many different individuals instead of just one) that interacts with those markets collectively determine the value of all the different available things that can be traded on the market.
</p>

<h3 id="maslows-hierarchy-is-made-up"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Maslow&rsquo;s Hierarchy Of Needs Is Made-Up</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-maslows-hierarchy-is-made-up">
<p>
The fact that people can create entirely different hierarchies of values according to their own theories of values contradicts the ranking of values within Maslow&rsquo;s Hierarchy of Needs. That being said, the &ldquo;exceptions&rdquo; to Maslow&rsquo;s Hierarchy of Needs should be seen as contradictions instead of exceptions. A true scientific theory would never have exceptions that contradict the theory itself. It would be more accurate to say that there is a tendency for physiological needs to rank above other needs, but this is by no means a law, just a strong tendency. Additionally, it would make the most sense to place Life and Reproduction at the top of the value hierarchy, according to a Darwinian perspective.
</p>

<p>
There is no higher authority who can tell you what to do with your life, or what is the right value, besides yourself. It is up to every individual to decide for themselves how their values should be judged, chosen, ranked, and prioritized, ideally in a <a href="#intro">rational manner</a>.

<h2 id="reproduction-objective-purpose"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Reproduction: Humanity&rsquo;s Objective Purpose</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-reproduction-objective-purpose">
<p>
A man&rsquo;s meaning and purpose is derived from his immutable biological identity as a reproducing machine. A man can choose to be an effective version of what he is, or he can choose to be an ineffective version of what he is. But he can&rsquo;t choose to not be a reproducing machine.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;Reproduction is your natural purpose, but you are not forced to accept it. You are free to accept it or reject it. God can’t make that choice for you. Neither can I.
If you choose reproduction as your purpose, then you will be a reproducing machine struggling to reproduce. You will have a purpose, but that purpose will not be transcendent and cosmic. It will be biological and personal.
If you reject your natural purpose, then you will still be a reproducing machine. Your nature will not change. You will still go through the motions of a reproducing machine: eating, sleeping, avoiding danger, pursuing love and sex, etc. But you will not reproduce.
The choice is yours.&rdquo;
&#x2013; Van Allen, T. K.. Immanentizing the Abyss. Kindle Edition.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
In accordance with accepting reproduction as the ultimate value, the values at the highest level of one&rsquo;s value hierarchy would probably be:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Valuing one&rsquo;s physiological needs,</li>
<li>An affirmation for the existence of biological life,</li>
<li>The supremacy of might makes right and the self-justifying nature of power,</li>
<li>The continuance of might makes right into the future,</li>
<li>Self-sustaining recursion, and</li>
<li>Reproduction as a biological reproducing machine that is designed to have and raise offspring.</li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-why-reproduction-is-ultimate">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All life is designed to reproduce because all life evolved to reproduce. Even if someone chooses not to have children, there is no denying that their bodies, desires, and even their DNA were all shaped by millions of years of continuous reproduction.</li>
<li>Holding reproduction as the main value to strive for avoids the misfortunes of Evolutionary Mismatch (as long as artificial barriers to reproduction are installed).</li>
<li>Having and raising children gives meaning to human lives, which gives them a goal to strive towards when fulfilling the power process<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>. It is natural for humans to want and like raising children.</li>
<li>Valuing reproduction is compatible with many biological, social, and psychological desires: the desires to have love, sex, children, raise them.</li>
<li>Having children and passing one&rsquo;s genes onto them is a way of ensuring a form of immortality, which has psychological benefits. DNA is the most intrinsic thing about any organism because every organism is an expression of what the DNA did in its environment.</li>
<li>The perception of immortality and having offspring that will continue the human species for a countless number of future generations gives humans something to look forwards to, having children and descendants that will forever continue the memory of human civilization and all good things that humans have done within their lives.</li>
<li>Reproduction and selection in humans is great for selecting good genes and excluding/de-selecting bad genes for future generations.</li>
<li>Aside from rewarding the most productive people and couples with more children, continuing human reproduction in the proposed manner of artificial barriers and incentives to continue to human civilization maintains genetic variation, which will help sustain the future human population through many crises.</li>
<li>If humans are designed to be reproducing machines that survive, struggle, and thrive, we might as well do it gloriously: forming empires with giant temples and monuments, colonizing the stars, keeping a massive archive of everything we&rsquo;ve done and achieved, and doing everything we can to prolong and further human civilization.</li>
<li>Setting reproduction as one&rsquo;s purpose in life immanentizes the abyss upon <a href="../misc/case-against-efilism#hedonism-is-not-self-evident">rejecting philosophical theories of value like hedonism</a>.</li>
<li>Reproduction is an <a href="../epistemology/knowledge#subject-object-dichotomy">organism&rsquo;s objective purpose</a>. Choosing to willingly affirm it as one&rsquo;s purpose in life on a personal level is to synchronize one&rsquo;s subjective purpose with their objective purpose.</li>

<h2 id="single-measurements-for-multiple-vars"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> General Single Measurements For Multiple Variables</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-single-measurements-for-multiple-vars">
<p>
In many cases, it&rsquo;s useful to have a single rating that works as a general measurement for multiple characteristics overall.
In spite of the dense amount of information that these general variables provide, their calculation and rating will always be arbitrary and debatable, especially for contentious topics like IQ scores and real estate values.
There&rsquo;s many factors that could influence these general measurements, many will dispute the weights of the factors, many people may be biased towards including/excluding various component factors, etc.
Some people will even argue that the analysis of these component factors will always be unfair no matter what since they arguably obscure many informational details, but there are indeed &ldquo;fair&rdquo; ways to create metrics that accurately assess, correlate, and synthesize the measurements of various component factors into dense amounts of information.
</p>

<p>
Examples Of General Variables That Depend On Multiple Component Factors:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Land Value Appraisal: location values, soil quality, natural resources (if any), condition of land / pollution levels, local flora and fauna, land area, improvements that cannot be reasonably separated from the land, etc.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Other Factors In Anti-Georgist Economies: interest rates, property tax rates, inflation rates, government subsidies, economic conditions, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Location Value: proximity to shops, businesses, schools, parks, etc; job markets, demographics, proximity to transportation networks (railroads, roads, harbors, airports, etc), vulnerability to natural disasters and pests/weeds, etc.</li>
<li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-iq-question.html">IQ Scores</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)">g-Factor</a>: logic abilities, visual reasoning, verbal reasoning, spatial reasoning, mathematical reasoning, processing speed, short-term memory, etc.</li>
<li>Racial Classification: <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#race-is-biological-examples">All the characteristics on this list</a>, etc.</li>
<li>Language Proficiency: speaking, reading, writing, listening, vocabulary, etc.</li>
<li>Language Classification within a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect_continuum">Dialect Continuum</a>: phonological characteristics, morphological characteristics, grammatical characteristics, semantic/vocabulary characteristics, etc.</li>
<li>Grades in school and university.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If someone believes that it&rsquo;s possible in any one of these scenarios to create a score, ranking, or category that assigns an overall rating for all the individual components together, then they also have to accept that the same can be done for all the other cases in this list, if they wish to be logically consistent.
The second way to be logically consistent is to believe that it&rsquo;s never possible to create variables that measure all these characteristics overall, but that is less reasonable because it would require denying knowledge that has predictive and explanatory power.
</p>

<p>
For example, if a Georgist claims that IQ cannot be measured accurately, but they also believe that <a href="https://gameofrent.com/content/can-land-be-accurately-assessed">(unimproved) land values can be accurately assessed</a>, then they have a contradiction.
If both of these general measures are based on multiple different factors, and one can be accurately assessed, then why not the other as well?
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart&rsquo;s Law</a>, Composition Fallacies, and Division Fallacies are often applicable to many of these phenomena.
