<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-integrating-four-skills">
<p>
Listening competence is universally &ldquo;larger&rdquo; than speaking competence.
In classrooms, students always do more listening than speaking.
</p>

<p>
We now understand that words and sentences carefully and slowly pronounced for classroom learners is <b>not</b> the real world.
The latter, which students in classrooms must be ready to face, is &ldquo;being able to identify words in the acoustic blur or normal conversational speech&rdquo; (G. Brown, 2010, p. 157).
This continues to be our current challenge, magnified by our awareness of the importance of context, culture, discourse, community, and other sociolinguistic variables.
</p>

<p>
TESOL specialists everywhere know what &ldquo;The Four Skills&rdquo; refers to: listening, speaking, reading, and writing, and usually in that order (from receptive to productive, and from most common to least common).
</p>

<p>
Listening frequently implies speaking, and in academic contexts possibly note-taking; speaking virtually always implies a listener; writing and reading are share obvious links; and the interconnections go on.
</p>

<p>
In L2 classrooms, we&rsquo;ll often find the following instances of integration:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A pre-reading discussion of a topic to activate schemata, followed by either a reading or a writing task.</li>
<li>Listening to a spoken lecture or monologue, accompanied by note-taking and followed by a discussion.</li>
<li>Writing a response to a reading passage.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Advantages of Integrating Two or More Skills
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Production and reception are two sides of the same coin.</li>
<li>Interaction involves sending and receiving messages.</li>
<li>By attending primarily to what learners can do with language, we invite any or all of the four skills that are relevant into the classroom arena.</li>
<li>One skill will often reinforce another.</li>
<li>Most of our natural language performance entails connections between language and the way we think, feel, and act.</li>

<li>Studies in the 90s and 2000s looked at the effect of a number of different contextual characteristics and how they affect the speed and efficiency of processing aural language. Rubin (1994) identified five such factors: text, interlocutor, task, listener, and process characteristics. In each case, important elements of the listening process were identified. For example, the listener characteristics of proficiency, memory, attention, affect, age, gender, background schemata, and even learning disabilities in the L1 all affect the process of listening (pp. 206–10).</li>
<li>Some studies have looked at the extent to which first language listening ability contributes to one&rsquo;s performance of second language listening, with the interesting suggestion by Vandergrift (2013) that if you&rsquo;re a good listener in your L1, you stand a good chance of doing well in L2 listening tasks.</li>
<li><p>
Studies tend to agree that listening, especially for academic and professional contexts, is a highly refined skill that requires a learner&rsquo;s attention to a battery of strategies for extracting meaning from texts (Flowerdew, 1994).
A fourth-century Chinese proverb says it eloquently:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Not to let a word get in the way of its sentence.
</p>

<p>
Nor to let a sentence get in the way of its intention,
</p>

<p>
But to send your mind out to meet the intention as a guest;
</p>

<p>
<i>That</i> is understanding.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Microskills (developed by Jack Richards in 1983) are involved in conversational discourse at the <span class="underline">sentence</span> level.</li>
<li>Macroskills designate skills that are technically at the <span class="underline">discourse</span> level.</li>
<li>The list of micro and macroskills is useful for forming clearly conceptualized objectives and testing criteria pertaining to listening comprehension, especially as it applies to conversational discourse.</li>
<li>Less interactive forms of discourse, such as listening to monologues like academic lectures, include further, more specific micro and macroskills (Flowerdew, 1994; Blackwell &amp; Naber, 2006; Sarosy &amp; Sherak, 2006) such as: 1. identifying the structure of a lecture, 2. weeding out what may be irrelevant or tangential, 3. detecting the possible biases of the speaker, 4. critically evaluating the speaker&rsquo;s assertions, and 5. developing means of retaining the content of a lecture (e.g. note-taking).</li>
<li>Both micro and macroskills can each use <span class="underline">bottom-up</span> and <span class="underline">top-down</span> processing, although the processing tends to apply respectively. Here are two examples where the two ways of processing do not apply respectively:</li>
<li>Microskill #3 (stress patterns or intonation) could adopt a top-down approach in which students are asked to simply listen to a stretch of spoken language without specifically having them focus on the details of stress or intonation.</li>
<li>Likewise, an activity involving recognition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(linguistics)">cohesive devices</a> (macroskill #11) might lend itself to a bottom-up approach in which specific devices are initially listed and explained, and only later provided in stretches of meaningful discourse.</li>
<li>Performance Variable: factors that typically take place in spoken conversation that reduce how well the speech flows (hesitations, false starts, pauses, and corrections).</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-listening-comprehension-processes">
<p>
The following seven processes, adapted from Clark and Clark (1977) and Richards (1983), are all involved in comprehension. With the exception of the initial and final processes below, no sequence is implied here; they all occur if not simultaneously, then in extremely rapid succession. Neurological time must be viewed in terms of microseconds.

<h3 id="7-listening-process-explained"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> The Seven Processes Involved In Listening Comprehension Explained In Detail</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-listening-process-explained">
<p>
Let&rsquo;s look at these seven processes in detail.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The hearer processes what we&rsquo;ll call &ldquo;raw speech&rdquo; and holds an &ldquo;image&rdquo; of it in short-term memory. This image consists of the constituents (phrases, clauses, cohesive markers, intonation, and stress patterns) of a stream of speech.</li>
<li>The hearer determines the type of speech event being processed (for example, a conversation, a speech, a radio broadcast) and then appropriately &ldquo;colors&rdquo; the interpretation of the perceived message. By attending to context and the content, for example, one determines whether the speaker wishes to persuade, request, exchange pleasantries, affirm, deny, inform, and so forth. Thus the function of the message is inferred.</li>
<li>The hearer recalls background information (or schemata; see Chapter 18 for more on this topic) relevant to the particular context and subject matter. A lifetime of experiences and knowledge is used to perform cognitive associations in order to bring a plausible interpretation to the message.</li>
<li>The hearer assigns a literal meaning to the utterance, a process that involves semantic interpretation. In many instances, literal and intended (see item 5) meanings match. So, for example, suppose one of your students walks into your office while you are very busy with something and says she has a question for you, then says, &ldquo;Do you have the time?&rdquo; You might answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the presumed literal meaning of the question. But then let&rsquo;s say a stranger sitting beside you on a bus looks at you and says, &ldquo;Do you have the time?&rdquo; Your appropriate response is not &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quarter to nine,&rdquo; which is appropriate for the metaphorical meaning of the question.</li>
<li>The hearer assigns an intended meaning to the utterance. The person on the bus intended to find out what time of day it was, even though the literal meaning didn&rsquo;t directly convey that message. How often do misunderstandings stem from incorrect assumptions that are made on the hearer&rsquo;s part about the intended meaning of the speaker? Such breakdowns can be caused by careless speech, inattention of the hearer, conceptual complexity, contextual miscues, psychological barriers, and
a host of other performance variables.</li>
<li>The hearer determines whether information should be retained in short-term or long-term memory. Short-term memory—a matter of a few seconds—is appropriate in contexts that call for a quick oral response from the hearer. Long-term memory is more common when, say, you are processing information in a lecture. There are, of course, many points in between.</li>
<li>The hearer deletes the form in which the message was originally received. Exact words, phrases, and sentences in normal speech acts are quickly forgotten, &ldquo;pruned&rdquo; of cognitive &ldquo;clutter.&rdquo; Instead, the important information, if any (see item 6 above), is retained conceptually. (See also PLLT, Chapter 4.)</li>
</ol>
<p>
It should be clear from the foregoing that listening comprehension is certainly an active undertaking (Goh, 2014), but more importantly an interactive process. After the initial reception of sound, we human beings perform at least six other major operations on that set of sound waves. In conversational settings, of course, further interaction takes place immediately after the listening stage as the hearer becomes speaker in a response of some kind.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-spoken-language-types" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="spoken-language-types"><span class="section-number-3">2.4.</span> Types Of Spoken Language</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-spoken-language-types">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Monologues
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Planned/rehearsed/spoken from a written text or notes</li>
<li>Spontaneous/impromptu/unplanned</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Dialogues
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Interpersonal/social/conversational</li>
<li>Transactional/informational/factual</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>
In monologues, when one speaker uses spoken language for any length of time, as in speeches, lectures, readings, news broadcasts, and the like, the hearer must process long stretches of speech without interruption—the stream of speech will go on whether or not the hearer comprehends.
Planned as opposed to spontaneous monologues differ considerably in their discourse structures.
Planned monologues (such as speeches and other prewritten material) usually manifest little redundancy and are therefore relatively difficult to comprehend.
Spontaneous monologues (impromptu lectures and long &ldquo;stories&rdquo; in conversations, for example) exhibit more redundancy, which makes for ease in comprehension, but the presence of more performance variables and other hesitations (see below) can either help or hinder comprehension.
</p>

<p>
Dialogues involve two or more speakers and can be subdivided into those exchanges that promote social relationships (<b>interpersonal</b>) and those for which the purpose is to convey propositional or factual information (<b>transactional</b>).
In each case, participants may have a good deal of shared knowledge (background information, schemata); therefore, the <span class="underline">familiarity</span> of the interlocutors will produce conversations with more assumptions, implications, and other meanings hidden between the lines.
In conversations between or among participants who are <span class="underline">unfamiliar</span> with each other, references and meanings have to be made more explicit to assure effective comprehension.
When such references are not explicit, misunderstandings can easily follow.
</p>

<p>
One could also have subdivided dialogues between those in which the hearer is a participant and those in which the hearer is an &ldquo;eavesdropper.&rdquo; In both cases, the above conversational descriptions apply, but the major—and highly significant—difference is that in the latter the hearer is, as in monologues, unable to interrupt or otherwise participate vocally in the negotiation of meaning.
</p>

<p>
Remember that in all cases these categories are really not discrete, mutually exclusive domains; rather, each dichotomy, as usual, represents a continuum of possibilities.
For example, everyday social conversations can easily contain elements of transactional dialogues, and vice versa.
Similarly, &ldquo;familiar&rdquo; participants may share very little common knowledge on a particular topic.
If each category, then, is viewed as an end point, you can aim your teaching at appropriate ranges in between.

<h3 id="8-challenges-to-listening-acquisition"><span class="section-number-3">2.5.</span> Eight Factors That Can Make Listening Acquisition More Difficult</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-challenges-to-listening-acquisition">
<p>
The following eight characteristics of spoken language are adapted from several sources (Richards, 1983; Ur, 1984; Dunkel, 1991; Flowerdew &amp; Miller, 2005).
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Clustering</b>:
In written language, we are conditioned to attend to the sentence as the basic unit of organization. In spoken language, due to memory limitations and our predisposition for &ldquo;chunking,&rdquo; or clustering, we break down speech into smaller groups of words. Clauses are common constituents, but phrases within clauses are even more easily retained for comprehension. In teaching listening comprehension, therefore, you need to help students to pick out manageable clusters of words; sometimes second language learners will try to retain overly long constituents (a whole sentence or even several sentences), or they will err in the other direction in trying to attend to every word in an utterance.</li>
<li><b>Redundancy</b>:
Spoken language, unlike most written language, has a good deal of redundancy. The next time you&rsquo;re in a conversation, notice the rephrasings, repetitions, elaborations, and little insertions of &ldquo;I mean&rdquo; and &ldquo;you know.&rdquo; Such redundancy helps the hearer to process meaning by offering more time and extra information. Learners can train themselves to profit from such redundancy by first becoming aware that not very new sentence or phrase will necessarily contain new information and by looking for the signals of redundancy. Learners might initially get confused by this, but with some training, they can learn to take advantage of redundancies as well as other markers that provide more processing time.</li>
<li><b>Reduced Forms</b>:
While spoken language does indeed contain a good deal of redundancy, it also has many reduced forms and sentence fragments. Reduction can be phonological (&ldquo;Djeetyet?&rdquo; for &ldquo;Did you eat yet?&rdquo;), morphological (contractions like &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&rdquo;), syntactic (elliptical forms like &ldquo;When will you be back?&rdquo; &ldquo;Tomorrow, maybe.&rdquo;), or pragmatic (phone rings in a house, child answers and yells to another room in the house, &ldquo;Mom! Phone!&rdquo;). These reductions pose significant difficulties, especially for classroom learners who may have initially been exposed to the full forms of the English language.</li>
<li><p>
<b>Performance Variables</b>:
In spoken language, except for planned discourse (speeches, lectures, etc.), hesitations, false starts, pauses, and corrections are common. Native listeners are conditioned from very young ages to weed out such performance variables, whereas they can easily interfere with comprehension in second language learners.
</p>

<p>
Imagine listening to the following verbatim excerpt of a sportsman talking about his game:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
But, uh—I also—to go with this of course if you&rsquo;re playing well—if you&rsquo;re playing well then you get uptight about your game. You get keyed up and it&rsquo;s easy to concentrate. You know you&rsquo;re playing well and you know . . . in with a chance then it&rsquo;s easier, much easier to—to you know get in there and—and start to . . . you don&rsquo;t have to think about it. I mean it&rsquo;s gotta be automatic.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In written form this looks like gibberish, but it&rsquo;s the kind of language we hear and process all the time. Learners have to train themselves to listen for meaning in the midst of distracting performance variables.
</p>

<p>
Everyday casual speech by native speakers also commonly contains ungrammatical forms. Some of these forms are simple performance slips. For example, &ldquo;We arrived in a little town that there was no hotel anywhere&rdquo; is something a native speaker could easily self-correct. Other ungrammaticality arises out of dialect differences (&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get no respect&rdquo;) that second language learners are likely to hear sooner or later.
</p></li>
<li><b>Colloquial Language</b>:
Learners who have been exposed to standard written English and/or &ldquo;textbook&rdquo; language sometimes find it surprising and difficult to deal with colloquial language. Idioms, slang, reduced forms, and shared cultural knowledge are all manifested at some point in conversations. Colloquialisms appear in both monologues and dialogues. Contractions and other assimilations often pose difficulty for the learner of English.</li>
<li><b>Rate of Delivery</b>:
Virtually every language learner initially thinks that native speakers speak too fast! Actually, as Jack Richards (1983) points out, the number and length of pauses used by a speaker is more crucial to comprehension than sheer speed. Learners will nevertheless eventually need to be able to comprehend language delivered at varying rates of speed and, at times, delivered with few pauses. Unlike reading, where a person can stop and go back to reread, in listening the hearer may not always have the opportunity to stop the speaker. Instead, the stream of speech will continue to flow!</li>
<li><b>Stress, Rhythm, and Intonation</b>:
The prosodic features of the English language are very important for comprehension. Because English is a stress-timed language, English speech can be a terror for some learners as mouthfuls of syllables come spilling out between stress points. The sentence &ldquo;The PREsident is INTerested in eLIMinating the emBARgo,&rdquo; with four stressed syllables out of eighteen, theoretically takes about the same amount of time to utter as &ldquo;Dead men wear plaid.&rdquo; Also, intonation patterns are very significant (see Chapter 16) not just for interpreting straightforward elements such as questions, statements, and emphasis but for understanding more subtle messages like sarcasm, endearment, insult, solicitation, or praise.</li>
<li><p>
<b>Interaction</b>:
Unless a language learner&rsquo;s objective is exclusively to master some specialized skill like monitoring radio broadcasts or attending lectures, interaction will play a large role in listening comprehension. Conversation is especially subject to all the rules of interaction: negotiation, clarification, attending signals, turntaking, and topic nomination, maintenance, and termination (see Chapter 8 of PLLT).
</p>

<p>
So, to learn to listen is also to learn to respond and to continue a chain of listening and responding.
</p>

<p>
Classroom techniques that include listening components must at some point include instruction in the two-way nature of listening.
</p>

<p>
Students need to understand that good listeners (in conversation) are good responders. They know how to negotiate meaning (to give feedback, to ask for clarification, to maintain a topic) so that the process of comprehending can be complete rather than being aborted by insufficient interaction.

<h3 id="listening-performance-types"><span class="section-number-3">2.8.</span> Types of Classroom Listening Performance</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-listening-performance-types">
<p>
The six types of listening performance listed here are ordered from a gradual increase in language ability as you progress up the scale from 1 to 6:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Reactive</b>:
Sometimes you want a learner simply to listen to the surface structure of an utterance for the sole purpose of repeating it back to you. While this kind of listening performance requires little meaningful processing, it nevertheless may be a legitimate, even though a minor, aspect of an interactive, communicative classroom. This role of the listener as merely a &ldquo;tape recorder&rdquo; (Nunan 1991b, p. 18) is very limited because the listener is not generating meaning. About the only role that reactive listening can play in an interactive classroom is in brief choral or individual drills that focus on pronunciation.</li>
<li><b>Intensive</b>:
Techniques whose only purpose is to focus on components (phonemes, words, intonation, discourse markers, etc.) of discourse may be considered to be intensive—as opposed to extensive—in their requirement that students single out certain elements of spoken language. They include the bottom-up skills (see p. 260) that are important at all levels of proficiency. Examples of intensive listening performance include the following:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Students listen for cues in certain choral or individual drills.</li>
<li>The teacher repeats a word or sentence several times to &ldquo;imprint&rdquo; it in the students&rsquo; mind.</li>
<li>The teacher asks students to listen to a sentence or a longer stretch of discourse and to notice a specified element, such as intonation, stress, a contraction, or a grammatical structure.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><b>Responsive</b>:
A significant proportion of classroom listening activity consists of short stretches of teacher language designed to elicit immediate responses. The students&rsquo; task in such listening is to process the teacher talk immediately and to fashion an appropriate reply. Examples include
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>asking questions (&ldquo;How are you today?&rdquo; &ldquo;What did you do last night?&rdquo;)</li>
<li>giving commands (&ldquo;Take a sheet of paper and a pencil.&rdquo;)</li>
<li>seeking clarification (&ldquo;What was that word you said?&rdquo;)</li>
<li>checking comprehension (&ldquo;So, how many people were in the elevator when the power went out?&rdquo;).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
<b>Selective</b>:
In longer stretches of discourse such as monologues of a couple of minutes or considerably longer, the task of the student is not to process everything that was said, but rather to scan the material selectively for certain information. The purpose of such performance is not to look for global or general meanings, necessarily, but to be able to find important information in a field of potentially distracting information. Such activity requires field independence (see PLLT, Chapter 5) on the part of the learner. Selective listening differs from intensive listening in that the discourse is in relatively long lengths. Examples of such discourse include:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Speeches</li>
<li>Media Broadcasts</li>
<li>Stories and Anecdotes</li>
<li>Conversations in which learners are &ldquo;eavesdroppers.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>
Techniques promoting selective listening skills could ask students to listen for:

<li><b>Extensive</b>:
This sort of performance, unlike the intensive processing (item 2) described above, aims to develop a top-down, global understanding of spoken language. For students in classrooms, extensive performance typically involves listening to lectures and other impromptu teacher monologues, commonly referred to as academic listening. Such listening may require the learner to invoke other interactive skills (e.g. note-taking, asking questions, discussion) for full comprehension (Flowerdew &amp; Miller, 2014). However, sometimes conversations involve attending to &ldquo;a long story,&rdquo; explanations, or descriptions, requiring the hearer to derive a comprehensive meaning or purpose.</li>
<li><b>Interactive</b>:
Finally, there is listening performance that can include all five of the above types as learners actively participate in discussions, debates, conversations, role-plays, and other pair and group work. Their listening performance must be intricately integrated with speaking (and perhaps other) skills in the authentic give and take of communicative interchange.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-principles-for-teaching-listening-skills">
<p>
Several decades of research and practice in teaching listening comprehension have yielded some practical principles for designing classroom aural comprehension techniques. These principles should help you to create your own techniques and activities. Some of them, especially the second and third, actually apply to any technique; the others are more germane to listening.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Include a Focus on Listening in an Integrated-Skills Course
</p>

<p>
Assuming that your curriculum is dedicated to the integration of all four skills, remember that each of the separate skills deserves special focus in appropriate doses.
</p>

<p>
It is easy to adopt a philosophy of just letting students &ldquo;experience&rdquo; language without careful attention to component skills.
</p>

<p>
Because aural comprehension itself cannot be overtly &ldquo;observed&rdquo; (see item 4 below), teachers sometimes incorrectly assume that the input provided in the classroom will be converted into learners&rsquo; long-term competence.
</p>

<p>
The creation of effective listening techniques requires studied attention to all the principles of listening already summarized in this chapter.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Include Pre-, While-, and Post-Listening Techniques
</p>

<p>
Learning to listen is not merely a matter of repeated listening, over and over, until the student &ldquo;gets it.&rdquo; For classroom lessons that involve a focus on a major listening event (such as an audio/video presentation, a news broadcast, or a teacher&rsquo;s planned lecture), effective lessons have been found to include three major stages (Richards &amp; Burns, 2012).
</p>

<p>
The first is a schemata-activating process that helps the learner to prepare for listening by checking vocabulary, ascertaining background knowledge that is essential for understanding, gaining a hint of what the topic is, and exploring any contextual factors that might otherwise make the listening difficult.
</p>

<p>
The second stage is one that can easily be neglected. You might assume that telling your students simply to &ldquo;listen to the audio/video&rdquo; that you&rsquo;re about to play is sufficient. Not true! Effective pedagogy will give students something to &ldquo;do&rdquo; while they are listening. Some examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Take notes</li>
<li>Fill in a chart</li>
<li>Note a sequence of events</li>
<li>Listen for the main idea</li>
<li>Listen for certain details</li>
</ul>
<p>
Remember, listening is an active process, so make sure your students are actively doing something while they listen.
</p>

<p>
Finally, what will students do <b>after</b> the presentation? We commonly think of questions or discussions to check comprehension, but this is only one form of post-listening activity that you can do.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
You might plan any of the following: a vocabulary or grammar check, difficulties that students had in comprehension (rapidity of speech, length, discourse complexity, content complexity), and/or extensions of the content of the listening passage to other related content.
This phase might involve everything from processing a handout to a general discussion, to a debate.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Carefully Consider the Form of Listeners&rsquo; Responses
</p>

<p>
Comprehension itself is not externally observable.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
We cannot peer into a learner&rsquo;s brain through a little window and empirically observe what is stored there after someone else has said something.
We can only infer that certain things have been comprehended through students&rsquo; overt (verbal or nonverbal) responses to speech.
It is therefore important for teachers to design techniques in such a way that students&rsquo; responses indicate whether or not their comprehension has been correct.
<a href="#guidelines-for-determining-listening-comprehension">Lund (1990) offered nine different ways that we can check listeners&rsquo; comprehension</a>.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Encourage the Development of Listening Strategies
</p>

<p>
Most foreign language students are simply not aware of how to listen.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
One of your jobs is to equip them with listening strategies that extend beyond the classroom.
<a href="#strategies-for-listening-comprehension">Draw their attention to the value of such strategies</a>.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Include Both Bottom-Up and Top-Down Listening Techniques
</p>

<p>
Speech-processing theory distinguishes between two types of processing in both listening and reading comprehension.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Bottom-up processing proceeds from sounds to words to grammatical relationships to lexical meanings, and so on, to a final &ldquo;message.&rdquo; Top-down processing is evoked from &ldquo;a bank of prior knowledge and global expectations&rdquo; (Morley, 1991a, p. 87) and other background information (schemata) that the listener brings to the text.
</p>

<p>
   Bottom-up techniques typically focus on the &ldquo;bits and pieces&rdquo; of language, breaking language into component parts and giving them central focus.
Top-down techniques are more concerned with the activation of schemata, with deriving meaning, with global understanding, and with the interpretation of a text.
It is important for learners to operate from both directions because both can offer keys to determining the meaning of spoken discourse.
But in a communicative, interactive context, you don&rsquo;t want to dwell too heavily on the bottom-up techniques, for to do so may hamper the development of a learner&rsquo;s all-important automaticity in processing speech.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-disambiguating-tests-and-assessments">
<p>
<span class="underline">Tests</span> and <span class="underline">Assessments</span> are not synonymous.
Tests are a type of <span class="underline">formal assessment</span>.
Tests fall into the latter category.
They are planned sets of tasks or exercises, with designated time frames, often announced in advance, prepared for (and sometimes feared) by students, and they characteristically offer specific scoring or grading formats.
</p>

<p>
Assessment is on ongoing pedagogical process that includes a number of evaluative acts on the part of the teacher.
The micro and macroskills of listening are indispensable for the assessment of listening.
</p>

<p>
When a student responds to a question, offers a comment, or tries out a new word or structure, the teacher subconsciously makes an evaluation of the student&rsquo;s performance.
A student&rsquo;s written work, from notes or short answers to essays, is judged by the teacher.
In reading and listening activities, students&rsquo; responses are implicitly evaluated.
All that is referred to as <span class="underline">informal assessment</span> because it is usually unplanned and spontaneous and without specific scoring or grading formats.
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">Formal assessment</span> on the other hand is more deliberate and usually has conventionalized feedback.
</p>

<p>
One of the first observations that needs to be made in considering assessment is that listening is unobservable.
You cannot directly see or measure or otherwise observe either the process or the product of aural comprehension.
</p>

<p>
So when it comes to assessing listening, we&rsquo;re pretty well stuck with reliance on our best inference in determining comprehension based on observed evidence.
How you do that, and remain as accurate in your assessment as possible, is the challenge of assessing listening.
