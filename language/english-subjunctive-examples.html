<p>
Subjunctive verb conjugations are so rare and unnoticed in Modern English these days that English speakers mistakenly believe that English doesn&rsquo;t have subjunctive mood.
</p>

<p>
Subjunctive verb conjugations are best seen in the third-person singular present tense conjugations for English verbs.
</p>

<p>
Recognizing and understanding how subjunctive conjugations work in English will help native English speakers learn how to use subjunctive conjugations in other languages.
</p>

<p>
Most Indo-European languages can conjugate verbs for the subjunctive mood.

<li>Using &rsquo;learn&rsquo; instead of &rsquo;learns&rsquo; marks the subjunctive mood in English.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Assuming the united kingdom <i>were</i> to leave the EU, they would regain control of their borders.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Using &rsquo;were&rsquo; instead of &rsquo;was&rsquo; marks the subjunctive mood in English.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It was fated that he <i>take</i> up arms against his will.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&rsquo;Take&rsquo; is in the subjunctive mood because it was describing an action that hadn&rsquo;t happened yet.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The natives would have mocked him had he chose otherwise.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&rsquo;Chose&rsquo; was used here instead because it was describing a hypothetical action.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What might &rsquo;spawn&rsquo; original creativity?

</ul></li>
<li>As you look around you, you must feel anxiety lest you fall below the level of achievement.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The use of the word &rsquo;lest&rsquo; will always trigger the subjunctive of any verb following it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As thou lookest around thee, thou must feel anxiety lest thou fall below the level of achievement.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The archaic use of thou and its conjugations also make the subjunctive appear visible since &rsquo;thou&rsquo; requires a different form in the indicative present tense and likewise has a noticeably different form in the subjunctive present mood.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If I were you, I would choose to win, win, win.
<ul class="org-ul">

<li>I could never do that, even if it were the most reasonable thing to do.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&rsquo;were&rsquo; instead of &rsquo;was&rsquo; or &rsquo;is&rsquo; is a subjunctive construction because it suggests that the action is not the most reasonable thing to do, but even if it hypothetically was the most reasonable thing to do, the speaker would not do it. Writing &rsquo;was&rsquo; or &rsquo;is&rsquo; instead of &rsquo;were&rsquo; would be indicative instead of subjunctive.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&ldquo;Be that as it may&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Truth be told&rdquo;</li>
