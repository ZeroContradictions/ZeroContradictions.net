<h2 id="sapir-whorf-theory"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> The Sapir-Whorf Theory</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-sapir-whorf-theory">
<p>
The Theory of Linguistic Relativity is a principle suggesting that the structure of a language influences its speakers&rsquo; worldview or cognition, and thus people&rsquo;s perceptions are relative to their spoken language.
Linguistic Relativity is traditionally known as the Sapir–Whorf Hypothesis, but I prefer to call it the Sapir-Whorf Theory instead since there is <a href="#sapir-whorf-examples">definitive evidence</a> that language <i>does</i> influence thought.
The Sapir-Whorf Theory is often brought up when discussing how the usage and ability of different human languages may influence human thought, but it&rsquo;s not necessary to speak another language in order to understand linguistic relativity.
It&rsquo;s sufficient to observe linguistic relativity within only a single language.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Language does for intelligence what the wheel does for the feet and the body. It enables them to move from thing to thing with greater ease and speed and ever less involvement. ― Marshall McLuhan, Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man
</p>

<p>
In this case, vocabulary is like a path or a rut that makes it more likely for people to follow that path than other paths.

<h3 id="gavagai"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> Gavagai And The Ambiguity Of Words</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-gavagai">

<div id="orgc3f7123" class="figure">
<p><img src="../images/gavagai.jpg" alt="gavagai.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 00px 00px 00px 20px;" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The original rendition of Gavagai gets rather unnecessarily abstract.
Suppose someone who doesn&rsquo;t share any language with you points at a rabbit and shots &ldquo;Gavagai!&rdquo;
The top pane of the comic suggests several possibilities &ldquo;Gavagai&rdquo; might mean:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>&ldquo;rabbit&rdquo; (obvious)</li>
<li>&ldquo;look!&rdquo; (a verb, e.g. look at where I&rsquo;m pointing)</li>
<li>&ldquo;prey/food/meal/animal&rdquo; (term more generic than rabbit)</li>
<li>&ldquo;white&rdquo; (an adjective, e.g. it&rsquo;s a white rabbit)</li>
<li>The specific name of that particular rabbit, like a pet&rsquo;s name.</li>
</ol>
<p>
&ldquo;Gavagai&rdquo; has multiple interpretations because the person who doesn&rsquo;t speak the language doesn&rsquo;t have any context for figuring out the specific meaning.
</p>

<p>
Some definitions can be better and more practical than others, and for different contexts.
A word&rsquo;s literal dictionary definition might be X, but in the minds of others it is Y.
The most common meaning and usage of words is determined by how people use said words, so its de facto definition becomes Y.
</p>

<p>
Ideally, definitions should conform to the most common meaning and usage of their respective words, but people can and should try to redefine definitions if there&rsquo;s a better meaning that clarifies confusion, especially on important issues.
A significant part of a conversation is clearing up misunderstandings of what people say during that conversation, especially when it comes to anything complicated or outside normal discourse.
Most people usually just translate whatever smarter people say into something else that fits into their brains better.
</p>


<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_definition">Wikipedia: Fallacies of Definition</a>
</p>


<p>
A &ldquo;false&rdquo; definition is said to be a definition deliberately designed to carry a connotation it doesn&rsquo;t deserve.
Alternatively, some people might say that it&rsquo;s a definition that defines something doesn&rsquo;t exist in reality, but that can be a useful concept for describing how reality is (in comparison to what it is not), so that it&rsquo;s a good conception of &ldquo;false definitions&rdquo;.

Strike-through text is great for indicating when the striked out text has an unfavorable choice of words for communicating the writer&rsquo;s thought and POV.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-political-metonym-examples">
<p>
Every ideology&rsquo;s name is a metonym for the supposed effects that different groups of people think that it would cause.
</p>

<p>
For example, when someone uses a political label, e.g. &ldquo;Libertarian!&rdquo;, nobody really knows the exact metonymy that they are actually referring to in their mind, because the literal definition of Libertarianism is only one somewhat unlikely possibility.

<h3 id="selective-attention"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> Selective Attention</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-selective-attention">
<p>
The key to making the Sapir-Whorf Effect work is Selective Attention.
All it takes is for our minds to subconsciously associate connotations with a term, or to get preconceived notions about what a concept is from the phrasing in which we learn about the concepts.
If we fail to pay enough attention, our preconceptions of the ideas will influence how we think about them.
As we shall see in the videos below, humans have limited attention spans, so it&rsquo;s always possible for someone to sneak details into our thoughts without us noticing.
</p>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWSxSQsspiQ">Selective Attention Test 3: The Door Study</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Sapir-Whorf functions more than once.
A higher-IQ person may catch the Sapir-Whorf they are paying attention to, but still get tricked by the ones they weren&rsquo;t:
Low-IQ people are dangerous by themselves, but they&rsquo;re even more dangerous when led by a (dishonest) high-IQ person.
Sapir-whorf is the puppet strings, and counter-sapir-whorf is severing the puppet strings.
In real life, in real politics, the real-puppet-masters and their strings are everywhere.
Every single idea, (e.g. Libertarianism, Race Realism, Georgism, EPC, etc) is getting attacked by Sapir-Whorf priming.
In order to succeed in politics, an idea has to be able to recognize how it has been primed and counter-signal it.

<a href="https://brittonicmemetics.wordpress.com/2020/06/26/designed-culture/">Memes compete for real estate in our brains</a>.
Corpus linguistics could be used to analyze the frequency of words and collocations in our speech, which can indicate which memes and thought patterns are most dominant within our minds, as well as what we&rsquo;re ignoring (what we talk don&rsquo;t talk about).
Collocations have major effects on our cognitive processing.

There&rsquo;s a very strong effect in politics where Conway&rsquo;s Law can be analyzed where the people who created content control what other people think (the &ldquo;Semantic Trojan Horse&rdquo;), the people who end up using the language that they read from that content in their every day speech and thoughts.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism">Pragmatism</a> is a philosophical tradition that considers words and thought as tools and instruments for prediction, problem solving, and action, and rejects the idea that the function of thought is to describe, represent, or mirror reality.

<h3 id="sapir-whorf-ideology-examples"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Sapir-Whorf Examples Regarding Political Ideology</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-sapir-whorf-ideology-examples">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Constitutions always say that the government must serve the people, but they never define who the &ldquo;people&rdquo; are. For example, slaves weren&rsquo;t considered part of &ldquo;the people&rdquo; in the US until 1865, and neither were Native Americans until 1924. Read more: <a href="../civilization/political-philosophy#defining-the-people">Defining Who &ldquo;The People&rdquo; Are</a></li>
<li>When &ldquo;Democracy&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Rule of the People&rdquo;, it fools the public into thinking that they have real power in the government.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The &ldquo;Deep State&rdquo; has connotations of being associated with craziness. If we want to talk to the public about it, we should instead use words like &ldquo;career politicians&rdquo; and &ldquo;unelected officials who make huge decisions&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;Russia&rdquo; refers ambiguously to the land area versus the people; and perhaps more interestingly, the people versus the government.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Saying that people employed by the US Department of Defense have &ldquo;served&rdquo; or &ldquo;served the country&rdquo; versus &ldquo;worked for the military&rdquo;.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The former gives the position a sense of honor, so it&rsquo;s kind of a way of bestowing honorifics via the verb form(s).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Saying that a government service &ldquo;loses money&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;costs money&rdquo;.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.g. &ldquo;The USPS is viewed favorably by 91% of Americans despite billions in losses annually.&rdquo;
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a service. It doesn&rsquo;t lose money. It costs money. No one says the military loses $750 billion / year.&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;student loan forgiveness&rdquo; versus &ldquo;debt cancellation&rdquo; versus &ldquo;stealing&rdquo;.</li>
<li>&ldquo;affordable housing&rdquo; avoids the negative connotations of &ldquo;low-income housing&rdquo; since the latter has become associated with increased crime rates and lower housing prices.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Affirmative Action&rdquo; versus &ldquo;Race Based Hiring&rdquo; or &ldquo;Race Based Admissions&rdquo;.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Gun Grabbers&rdquo; versus &ldquo;Gun Control Activists&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Hate Speech&rdquo; is used as an excuse to limit &ldquo;Free Speech&rdquo;.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>From the other perspective, &ldquo;Free Speech&rdquo; is an excuse to allow &ldquo;Hate Speech&rdquo;.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="../civilization/thoughts-on-social-justice">&ldquo;Equal Representation&rdquo; versus &ldquo;Diversity&rdquo;</a> versus Anti-White Racism.</li>
<li>The Sapir-Whorf of &ldquo;Assault Rifle&rdquo;.</li>
<li>&ldquo;politically correct&rdquo; and &ldquo;politically incorrect&rdquo;.</li>
<li>First-Worlders live in an economy that is said to be &ldquo;Capitalist&rdquo;, so socialists, communists, and other left-wingers attribute all of the economy&rsquo;s failures to capitalism, even though <a href="../economics/georgism-crash-course">the unequal and inefficient distribution of land is actually the main source of the world&rsquo;s economic problems</a>, not Capitalism.</li>
<li>The Sapir-Whorf of Communism / Communist. Many people will say &ldquo;Communist China&rdquo;, even though China is now closely to Fascism than Communism like it used to be.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some Communists associate &ldquo;Communism&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;Community&rdquo;, which distorts their perception and understanding of what &ldquo;Communism&rdquo; is.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Sapir-Whorf of &ldquo;Nazi&rdquo; as &ldquo;National Socialist&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The Sapir-Whorf of &ldquo;Antifa&rdquo; as &ldquo;Anti-Fascist&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The Sapir-Whorf of &ldquo;social contract&rdquo; versus &ldquo;Implicit Mutual Social Agreement (IMSA)&rdquo;.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Voluntaryism&rdquo; versus &ldquo;Anarcho-Capitalism&rdquo;. &ldquo;Voluntary&rdquo; itself is a contrived term since <a href="../epistemology/free-will#agency-is-circumstantial">agency is entirely circumstantial</a>.</li>
<li>Augustus assumed the title of &ldquo;First Citizen&rdquo; or &ldquo;Princeps&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;King&rdquo; or &ldquo;Rex&rdquo;.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The meaning and semantic change of the words &ldquo;well-regulated&rdquo; in the Second Amendment of the US Constitution.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;well-regulated&rdquo; originally meant &ldquo;well-functioning&rdquo;, but the meaning of the word &ldquo;regulate&rdquo; changed around over the centuries, especially during the Prohibition and Great Depression Era.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Everybody keeps saying &ldquo;Malthus was wrong&rdquo; when some people say that we need to take overpopulation more seriously, even though they never said that Malthus was right.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Malthus&rsquo;s thesis was that subsistence agriculture is the main factor limiting population size. But since he was wrong about that, and since Malthusianism and Neo-Malthusianism have both become words for expressing concern with overpopulation, everybody associates negative connotations with just the word &ldquo;Neo-Malthusianism&rdquo;.</li>
<li>As a result, there really aren&rsquo;t any good words for expressing overpopulation concerns without people immediately jumping to saying &ldquo;MaLtUs wAs WrOnG!&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;finite&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t exactly a concrete word. Georgists think it means one thing, and Ancaps/non-Georgists think it means another.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There&rsquo;s different &ldquo;finiteness&rdquo; to physics too. The sun is infinite as far as our lifetime is concerned. Oil less so. Nuclear more so.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When people are used to hearing about &ldquo;buying and selling houses&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;buying and selling land&rdquo;, this leads them to think that it&rsquo;s the house itself makes up most of the property value, even though in most cases, it&rsquo;s actually the <i>land</i> underneath the house that holds most of the value. The 2008 Housing Crisis was caused by the popping of a real estate bubble caused by land speculation (and the loaning of land/houses to people who couldn&rsquo;t afford the mortgages).</li>
<li>Calling &ldquo;Land Value Tax&rdquo; a &ldquo;tax&rdquo; causes Alloidal Libertarians and Ancaps to think that it&rsquo;s a bad thing, even though it&rsquo;s arguably not a tax since it doesn&rsquo;t deprive people of the fruits of their labor, since land is not created by labor.</li>
<li>Labeling incidents as &ldquo;riots&rdquo; vs &ldquo;protests&rdquo;. Nowadays, the difference and labeling between the two has become very politicized, thus bringing the terms into people&rsquo;s selective attention and reducing the possibility that the term chosen affects people&rsquo;s judgements and thinking.</li>
<li>The definition of &ldquo;crime&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s been recent movements to rename the phrase &ldquo;commit suicide&rdquo; to &ldquo;die by suicide&rdquo; instead, and there&rsquo;s of course lots of disagreement about what counts as a &ldquo;crime&rdquo; (e.g. jaywalking?, prostitution?, pirating books/music/movies?, et cetera)</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The Definition of &ldquo;Morality&rdquo;: Some people assume that morality is objective, while others assume that it is subjective or inter-subjective. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/morality#English">Morality has many different definitions</a>.</li>
<li>When people are inclined to say that &ldquo;altruism&rdquo; is a good thing since it is often defined as &ldquo;helping others&rdquo;, even though a better definition is &ldquo;Acting for the benefit of other, at some cost to oneself&rdquo;. See: <a href="../FAQs/post-overton-FAQs#definition-of-selfishness">Post-Overton FAQs</a></li>
<li>When people are inclined to say that &ldquo;selfishness&rdquo; is a bad thing since it is often defined as &ldquo;Acting for your own benefit, at the expense of others&rdquo;, even though a better definition is &ldquo;Acting for your own benefit, regardless of others&rdquo;. See: <a href="../FAQs/post-overton-FAQs#definition-of-selfishness">Post-Overton FAQs</a></li>
<li>The use of value as both a verb and a noun contributed to <a href="https://www.spreaker.com/user/blitheringgenius/talkingtodifferentt">this person&rsquo;s inability to understand that perceived value depends on perspective</a>. For example, he said that &ldquo;wood has value <i>as</i> firewood&rdquo;, but thinking of value as a noun makes it harder to think of value and the act of valuing something as a subject-object relation.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Selfish Gene&rdquo; is a misleading metaphor. It&rsquo;s true that life is intrinsically selfish, but the metaphor causes people to mistakenly believe in false ideas like kin altruism and the genocentric theory of evolution, in large part because people failed to evaluate if genes can truly be selfish or not. There are several problems with the metaphor, as explained in <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPXJ85W7">Debunking the Selfish Gene</a></i>.</li>

<h3 id="why-Qs-examples"><span class="section-number-3">3.2.</span> Examples Of Why-Questions That Start Scientific Inquiries</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-why-Qs-examples">
<p>
Often science begins with Why-questions. Here are some examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why are the animals and plants of this world the way they are?</li>
<li>Why does lightning occur?</li>
<li>Why is iron magnetic?</li>
<li>Why are voiceless obstruents more common than voiced obstruents among the world&rsquo;s languages?</li>
<li>Why are there so many similar species across Earth&rsquo;s continents?</li>
<li>What do kidneys do?</li>
<li>What causes fire?</li>
<li>Why are humans the way they are?</li>
</ul>
<p>
However, it is often the case that when answering <i>why</i> something happens we end up explaining how it happens. By the definition of &ldquo;<i>why</i>&rdquo;, someone could easily just state the motive, cause, or reason of whatever subject the question is asking about in a single stands or just a few words, but when the question is being asked with an expectation of an in-depth answer, answering with only a single sentence or a few words is not acceptable, thus very descriptive and comprehensive descriptions have to be given in order to answer the question. Nevertheless, it is still the case that in order to answer &ldquo;<i>why</i>&rdquo; questions, we must explain how things work and answer other questions along the way as they come up before we can answer the original &ldquo;<i>Why?</i>&rdquo; question.
</p>

<p>
But in doing so, it also becomes possible to ask a similar question that is reworded such that it asks &ldquo;How?&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; and leads to the exact same answer. And then when the answer is talk to future learners who are learning about the topic, The questions are more likely to be presented as asking &ldquo;How?&rdquo; instead of asking &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;, although sometimes they might still be asked with &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;, especially if it just feels more natural to ask the questions with that interrogative and/or The person asking the question has no idea where to start answering it or the concepts needed to explain the answer to the question that they want to know.
another way to think of the difference between How and Why is that &ldquo;How?&rdquo; is the same question as &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; except that &ldquo;How?&rdquo; is asking for more detailed answer.

Are there languages that make different semantic distinctions between their equivalent ways to asking <i>how</i> and/or <i>why</i>? if so, what kinds of semantic differences exist between those languages and English&rsquo;s way of saying things?
Known Examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>¿Por qué? and ¿Para qué? in Spanish</li>

Science aims to describe the <i>how</i>&rsquo;s of how reality works <i>before</i> explaining the <i>why</i>&rsquo;s. What religion does instead is it skips over the <i>how</i>&rsquo;s and jumps straight to answering the <i>why</i> questions, and then it uses the fabricated answers to those <i>Why?</i> questions to answer the <i>How?</i> questions about how reality works. Religion fails to correctly understand the world precisely because it works in the opposite direction that Science does (Science would describe <i>how</i> reality works before it ever describes <i>why</i>, if it ever even gets to that point).
</p>

<p>
More specifically, when science doesn&rsquo;t do a very good job of explaining the why&rsquo;s about realities, these why&rsquo;s relate to ontologies (e.g. gravity, creation of universe, forces of universe, chemical structure of universe, properties of universe, etc)
</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;<i>Why</i>&rdquo; Before &ldquo;<i>How</i>&rdquo;? Razor is probably the simplest, the most general, and most general way to reject all supernatural phenomena (including God) in a single argument. And the simplicity of the argument could be fittingly explained after explaining the reasoning process and the criteria and nature of degrees of certainty/skepticism and why arbitrary statements are not epistemically valid.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-how-religion-works">
<p>
The only way anyone could possibly explain <i>why</i> something works before describing <i>how</i> it works is if they fabricated a bunch of false made-up premises to explain the <i>why</i>&rsquo;s, and then used the understanding generated by those false made-up assumptions to explain the how&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
But of course, the main purpose of religion besides helping people <b>think</b> they know why the world works the way it does is to give people a philosophy of sorts (obviously not a rational one though) for understanding why they should live their lives the way they do / think they should. So although religion uses fabricated nonsense to explain the &ldquo;<i>how</i>&rdquo; questions of life, it needs to create the fabrications for explaining the &ldquo;hows&rdquo; in such a way that it helps them live their lives. For example, religious people often believe that God favored monogamy, and so they make monogamy part of their religion and use the fabrication of God to help explain it. i
</p>

<p>
During the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment humans had for the first time in many millennia started trying to explain the <i>how</i>&rsquo;s of Reality instead of the <i>why</i>&rsquo;s. And it is during this era that people started rejecting religion in mass for the first time, because they started rejecting the commonplace epistemic error of trying to explain Why before explaining How, and believing in religion as the fallacious conclusion.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-wrong-philosophical-Qs">
<p>
A critical reason why philosophical progress hasn&rsquo;t progressed very far historically is because people are asking the wrong questions, in large because people can only ask questions that come to their minds, not questions that they never would have thought to ask given their environment, education, and circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Often times, people are asking the wrong questions:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Is the mind tabula rasa? -<a href="../epistemology/1D-tabula-rasa-and-ECG#evaluating-tabula-rasa">The answer is too complicated to definitively say yes or no to this question</a>.</li>
<li>Which planet is the closest planet to Earth? -The answer depends on what you mean by the closest planet to Earth. There are four different questions that have more precise answers such that they each have clear, unambiguous answers.</li>
<li>Should we obey the law? -The correct question to ask is: Is the law reasonable/justified? And the answer is: No, we should try it, but until we can change it, our best option is (probably) to follow it.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Is there a God? -We should ask: Define God?</li>
<li>Is the mind tabula rasa? -We should ask: Is the mind ever tabula rasa, to what extent, and at what stages of developments?</li>
<li>Do we have free will? -We should ask: How do we define free will? Besides determinism, what are the alternatives if we don&rsquo;t have free will? Is &rsquo;probability&rsquo; (define) one of them?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Perhaps it&rsquo;s wrong to ask if it&rsquo;s determinism or if it&rsquo;s free will. Maybe it&rsquo;s just probability and hence neither deterministic or free will.</li>

<li>What ethics should we live under? -Is morality subjective or objective?

</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve never agreed with the Transcendental Argument for God (TAG), but I&rsquo;ve always thought that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence_of_God#Cosmological_argument">Cosmological Argument</a> was the best argument for God, however it could only prove a non-supernatural Deistic God(s) at best. <a href="https://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_deism">Deism</a> is basically the position that God created the Universe, but no longer intervenes in its affairs. Nobody may completely understand why the universe was created, but even then, it is highly dishonest to conclude that an all-knowing, all-powerful magical man was the creator without evidence and for lack of a better explanation. Every supernatural definition of God is non-existent.

<p>
If we insist that everything has a creator, we get:

<td class="org-left">Universe</td>
<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>
<td class="org-left">&lt;- ∞ of creators</td>

</tbody>

<p>
If we insist that the Universe is eternal or God is eternal, we get:
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<td class="org-left">Atheism:</td>
<td class="org-left">Universe</td>
<td class="org-left">&#xa0;</td>

<p>
Atheism is simpler in both cases.
