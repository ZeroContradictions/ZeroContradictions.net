<h2 id="intro"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Georgism Used To Be Very Popular During The Late 19th And Early 20th Century</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
The Georgism movement used to be as popular as the Eugenics movement was during the early 1900s, and Georgism was a major part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Era#Researchers_and_intellectual_theorists">activism during the Progressive Era</a>.
</p>

<p>
Henry George&rsquo;s 1879 book <i>Progress &amp; Poverty</i> was the second best-selling book in the entire world during the 1880s and 1890s, outsold by only the Bible. Nobody knows exactly how many copies it sold during those two decades because nobody was keeping track, but it definitely sold at least several millions of copies for sure. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Era">Progressive Era</a> is literally named after the book itself.
</p>

<p>
Georgism used to have tons of followers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism#Notable_Georgists">and many of them were very famous people</a>. When Henry George died in 1897 (just a few days before the election for New York City mayor), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_George#Death_and_funeral">an estimated 100,000 people attended this funeral</a>.
</p>

<p>
The mid-20th century labor economist and journalist George Soule wrote that George was &ldquo;By far the most famous American economic writer,&rdquo; and &ldquo;author of a book which probably had a larger world-wide circulation than any other work on economics ever written.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Few people know it, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)">board game Monopoly</a> and its predecessor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Landlord%27s_Game">The Landlord&rsquo;s Game</a> were actually created to demonstrate that an economy that rewards individuals is better than one where monopolies hold all the wealth and to promote the economic theories of Henry George, as noted in the second introduction paragraph of the Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)">board game Monopoly</a>.
</p>

<p>
So if Georgism used to have millions of supporters and solid economic reasoning, why did it never catch on and how did it lose its popularity over the past century?

<h2 id="20th-century-mistakes"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Reasons Why Georgism Lost Its Popularity As The 20th Century Progressed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-20th-century-mistakes">
<p>
A century&rsquo;s worth of successive mistakes in the making, these are the main reasons why Georgism lost its popularity as the 1900s progressed:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The rising popularity of automobiles, especially the Ford Model T, put downward pressure on land values. Before the automobile made it possible to expand cities outward and create urban sprawl, the high cost of living in urban centers was even more noticeable than it was today. Additionally, the development of the national highway system during the 1950s further increased the United States&rsquo; reliance on cars.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO0BZqQ42Ic">City Beautiful: How do cities grow?</a></li>
<li>TL;DW: Cities grow according to what becomes the most dominant transportation method. Since cars managed to become the dominant transportation method before high-speed rail did, car-centric urban planning was developed instead, even though the consensus decades later is that it was less efficient, and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re stuck with car-centric urban planning, which makes achieving pro-Georgist reform significantly more difficult.</li>
<li>People may be able to enjoy the lower cost of living enabled by living on lower-value land (and even land speculating) today, but this actually curtails economic growth in the long-run.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The rise of mortgages made it easier for the middle class to do land speculation. When Georgism was popular, the rentier class was small. Now that the rentier class is big, the supporters for Georgism today are small. Driven by personal finance articles and advice titled similarly to &ldquo;homeownership is the key to the wealth&rdquo;, the government has done everything they can to encourage this rent-seeking, and word-of-mouth has made this all even worse. Each mortgage is a speculative bet on the future value of the house, in a way. Today, the majority of the population engages in some type of land speculation through the property and mortgage market. In essence, this is a market failure. Rent-seeking does not generate wealth, and every real estate bubbles has to come to a crash eventually.</li>
<li>Keynesian, Fascist, and Communist ideologies became popular in America and Europe during the 1930s and 1940s, thus distracting the public from Georgist solutions to the Great Depression and other economic woes. After the Nazis fell, Communist ideas became very popular in Europe, even in countries like France. Even worse, Keynesian ideas were credited with ending the Great Depression, and Keynesianism eventually became the dominant school of economic thought in the Western World.</li>
<li>The Cold War polarized the world between Neoclassicalists and Communism, thus creating the Capitalism-Communism Dichotomy, and further burying Georgism into history and distracting the public. By this point, a lot of the Georgists earlier in the century and the previous one had already died off.</li>
<li>If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_Gaffney">Mason Gaffney</a>&rsquo;s position is to be believed, rich land barons like Leland Stanford funded the first economics departments at US universities and staffed them with avowed anti-Georgists, who created neoclassical economics with the express purpose of rewriting all of economics terminology to confound Georgist arguments and erase Henry George from history. Unfortunately, they succeeded. This is explained in more detail in this excerpt from Gaffney&rsquo;s book: <a href="https://www.masongaffney.org/publications/K1Neo-classical_Stratagem.CV.pdf">Neo-Classical Strategem As A Strategy Against Henry George</a> Not only that, but <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/05/why-most-academic-research-is-fake.html?view=classic">Academia in general has been corrupted by a filter bubble of its own</a>.</li>
<li>There are millions of homeowners in America that would rather see the market value of their houses increase than to implement Georgism. Buying land has become the most popular way of securing capital, and while that leads to a lot of problems, taxing their land value that would mean the middle class would lose what they invested their life savings into (the land their houses sit on).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If voters don&rsquo;t want their land prices to decrease through a land value tax, any proposal to implement such a tax is doomed because that would entail the voters having to willingly vote against their own interests and tax their own wealth/land holdings.</li>
<li>Given the circumstances, any modern attempt to implement Georgism nowadays would have to see a gradual transition of at least 30 years away from other taxes (starting with property taxes), coupled by a gradual increase in LVT until land value is taxed at a 100% rate. 30 years would be an entire generation, and should give everyone enough time to readjust their personal finances as the society transitions to Georgism.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The economic rhetoric of the 20th century got polarized between Neoclassicalism and Marxism because each side found it convenient to group all their enemies into the other side. Notice how whenever you bring up georgism, the Neoclassicalists accuse you of being a filthy greedy commie, the Marxists accuse you of being a filthy capitalist pig, and Alloidal Libertarians accuse you of being a &ldquo;statist&rdquo; or &ldquo;land communist&rdquo; because their brains have been wired to hear &ldquo;tax&rdquo; and think &ldquo;bad&rdquo;. Most people aren&rsquo;t even aware that the board game Monopoly was created to promote Georgism since they mistakenly use the game to promote their own ideological biases instead.</li>
<li>High school students tend to be taught Keynesian Economics and Supply-Side Economics, and Georgism is never mentioned at all in high school history and economics textbooks, not even most college economics textbooks for that matter (because academia has been corrupted). Also note that Georgism is never mentioned in the the crash course economics series.</li>
<li>Nowadays, there are hardly any famous Georgist advocates and intellectuals who are bringing the idea into the public&rsquo;s eye. Virtually all the famous Georgists noted on the Georgism Wikipedia article are all dead. Nowadays, people are massively divided by filter bubbles, especially due to the rise of the internet and increased political polarization. Most people have never heard of Georgism, and most of those who have heard of it don&rsquo;t understand it. On top of all that, there are no major news outlets that publish ideas and arguments to promote Georgism among the public.</li>
<li>Georgism is not intuitive enough for the general public. Memes and cultures evolved to think about labor, not land.</li>
<li>Although Sun Yat-Sen was a Georgist who became the first head of state of the Republic of China in 1911, Yuan Shikai became the new head of state, failed to reinstate monarchy in China, abdicated, and died, thus causing China to become fragmented into being controlled by warlords from 1916 to 1928. Sun Yat-Sen died in 1925, Communists took control of some parts of China during the Warlord Era, and Chiang Kai-Shek started oppressing democracy and paying lip service to Sun&rsquo;s ideals. So although the Kuomintang was initially a Georgist party when it first ruled and was first led by a Georgist, Georgism never took hold in China due to an unfortunate sequence of events. This is even more unfortunate when it can be considered that the nationwide implementation of Georgism in China could&rsquo;ve dissuaded people from aiding the eventual Communist takeover, which would&rsquo;ve changed the entire course of China&rsquo;s history for the better compared to today.</li>

<h2 id="repopularizing-georgism"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Ideas For Re-Popularizing Georgism</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-repopularizing-georgism">
<p>
Georgism was popular once, and it can be popular again. The modern era has exhausted both its solutions and its revolutions, and people are beginning to look for ways to fix the problems unfolding in front of them. In the past year alone, there has been a Georgist resurgence. So, with a firm determination and intelligent labor, it is entirely possible for us to begin a new epoch of society.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The growing influence of the FIRE Movement will definitely help to counteract people&rsquo;s opposition to Georgism. Since the FIRE Movement aims to help people (especially younger people) build up all their retirement savings so that they can retire at earlier ages, say in their 30s or 40s, this could help people become less reliant on owning homes as part of their retirement plan since it wouldn&rsquo;t be as practical to buy a home when young and watch its land value increase until the homeowner sells it to make up a huge chunk of their retirement plan. On the other hand, this might not work favorable since having lots of money at younger ages would put people in a position to buy more expensive homes that they could still land speculate on to some extent. In any case, it should help to reduce reliance on homeowner land speculation to some extent.</li>
<li>People who believe in supply-side economics might be some of the easiest people to convert to Georgist economics. The Laffer Curve assumes that the government has to be funded by a tax that decreases economic output, but this is made obsolete since it is recognized that collecting Land Value Tax instead would not decrease economic output. On r/neoliberal, almost all of the users there support Georgism, so we know that they are some of the people who are already the most receptive to the idea.</li>
<li>Worsening housing and rent problems in California, Idaho, major metropolitan areas, Japan, China, and other places that are facing housing shortages could also invoke movement towards Georgism, if Georgism can be promoted such that people will recognize that it&rsquo;s the solution to the housing crises.</li>
<li>Restructuring urban planning to be more walkable and less reliant on to cars would help, but this would take decades, at which point, cars would be both electric-powered and self-driving.</li>
<li>Educating people about economics. Although Georgism may not be intuitive, we can still try to recruit people who wade great influence to help promote it, like educational Youtube channels that have millions of subscribers.</li>
<li>Educating people about <a href="../epistemology/3-evolution-theorems.html#biorealism-external-links">Biological Realism</a>. In my personal experience, I have never met a <a href="../FAQs/EPC-FAQs.html">Laissez-Faire Eugenicist</a> who is opposed to Georgism. I&rsquo;ve found that every time I&rsquo;ve introduced them to my <a href="../economics/georgism-elevator-pitch.html">Georgism Elevator Pitch</a>, my essay explaining <a href="../economics/georgism-EPC-connection.html">the Connection between Georgism and Eugenic Population Control</a>, and I&rsquo;ve answered all their other questions, they&rsquo;ve always been extremely receptive to supporting Georgism. This doesn&rsquo;t surprise me at all since people who are willing to support such a taboo idea like Laissez-Faire Eugenics<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> tend to be more open-minded to begin with.</li>
