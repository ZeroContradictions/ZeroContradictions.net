<h2 id="intro"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Georgism Used To Be Very Popular During The Late 19th And Early 20th Century</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
The Georgism movement used to be as popular as the Eugenics movement was during the early 1900s, and Georgism was a major part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Era#Researchers_and_intellectual_theorists">activism during the Progressive Era</a>.
</p>

<p>
Henry George&rsquo;s 1879 book <i>Progress &amp; Poverty</i> was the second best-selling book in the entire world during the 1880s and 1890s, outsold by only the Bible. Nobody knows exactly how many copies it sold during those two decades because nobody was keeping track, but it definitely sold at least several millions of copies for sure. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Era">Progressive Era</a> is literally named after the book itself.
</p>

<p>
Georgism used to have millions of followers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism#Notable_Georgists">and many of them were very famous people</a>. When Henry George died in 1897 (just a few days before the election for New York City mayor), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_George#Death_and_funeral">an estimated 100,000 people attended this funeral</a>.
</p>

<p>
The mid-20th century labor economist and journalist George Soule wrote that George was &ldquo;By far the most famous American economic writer,&rdquo; and &ldquo;author of a book which probably had a larger world-wide circulation than any other work on economics ever written.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Few people know it, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)">board game Monopoly</a> and its predecessor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Landlord%27s_Game">The Landlord&rsquo;s Game</a> were actually created to demonstrate that an economy that rewards individuals is better than one where monopolies hold all the wealth and to promote the economic theories of Henry George, as noted in the second introduction paragraph of the Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)">board game Monopoly</a>.
</p>

<p>
So if Georgism used to have millions of supporters and solid economic reasoning, why did it never catch on and how did it lose its popularity over the past century?
</p>

<h2 id="20th-century-mistakes"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Reasons Why Georgism Lost Its Popularity As The 20th Century Progressed</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-20th-century-mistakes">
<p>
A century&rsquo;s worth of successive mistakes in the making, these are the main reasons why Georgism lost its popularity as the 1900s progressed:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
The rising popularity of automobiles, especially the Ford Model T, put downward pressure on land values. Before the automobile made it possible to expand cities outward and create urban sprawl, the high cost of living in urban centers was even more noticeable than it was today. Additionally, the development of the national highway system during the 1950s further increased the United States&rsquo; reliance on cars.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HO0BZqQ42Ic">City Beautiful: How do cities grow?</a></li>
<li>TL;DW: Cities grow according to what becomes the most dominant transportation method. Since cars managed to become the dominant transportation method before high-speed rail did, car-centric urban planning was developed instead, even though the consensus decades later is that it was less efficient, and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re stuck with car-centric urban planning, which makes achieving pro-Georgist reform significantly more difficult.</li>
<li>People may be able to enjoy the lower cost of living enabled by living on lower-value land (and even land speculating) today, but this actually curtails economic growth in the long-run.</li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Generally speaking, the US always used the Manifest Destiny as an excuse not to consider land scarcity. Now that there&rsquo;s no more land to manifest and most of the country&rsquo;s cities have car-centric urban planning, this is already hurting economic growth from what could&rsquo;ve been.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The rise of mortgages made it easier for the middle class to do land speculation. When Georgism was popular, the rentier class was small. Now that the rentier class is big, the supporters for Georgism today are small. The government, word-of-mouth, and personal finance articles and advice titled similarly to &ldquo;homeownership is the key to the wealth&rdquo; have made the problem worse by encouraging this rent-seeking. Today, the majority of the population engages in some type of land speculation through the property and mortgage market.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Each mortgage is a speculative bet on the future value of the house. Buying land has become the most popular way of securing capital. While that leads to a lot of problems, taxing land value that would mean the middle class would lose what they invested their life savings into (the land their houses sit on).</li>
<li>When land economics is explained to most people, they don&rsquo;t care to understand that land speculation is the problem with the economy. They only care to know how they could use it to make themselves better off, so they don&rsquo;t realize that it actually makes everybody collectively worse off in the long run.</li>
<li>Given these circumstances, any modern attempt to implement Georgism nowadays would have to see a gradual transition of at least 30 years away from other taxes (starting with property taxes), coupled by a gradual increase in LVT until land value is taxed at a 100% rate. 30 years would be an entire generation, and should give everyone enough time to readjust their personal finances as the society transitions to Georgism.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Keynesian, Fascist, and Communist ideologies became popular in America and Europe during the 1930s and 1940s, thus distracting the public from Georgist solutions to the Great Depression and other economic woes. After the Nazis fell, Communist ideas became very popular in Europe, even in countries like France. Even worse, Keynesian ideas were credited with ending the Great Depression, and Keynesianism eventually became the dominant school of economic thought in the Western World.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Prohibition caused the US government&rsquo;s revenue to switch from being dependent on liquor excise taxes to being dependent on income taxes. When FDR increased the size of the US federal government during the 30s and 40s, sales, property, and especially income taxes grew, but Land Value Tax was never considered.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Cold War polarized the world between Neoclassical Economics and Marxist Economics. This created the Capitalism-Communism Dichotomy, while further burying Georgism into history and distracting the public. By this point, a lot of the Georgists earlier in the century and the previous one had already died off.</li>
<li>Henry George died of a stroke in 1897 at the age of 58 years old, just four days before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_mayoral_elections#1897_to_1913">1897 NYC mayoral election</a>. He also placed second in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1886_New_York_City_mayoral_election">1886 NYC mayoral election</a>, which was a three-way race. Since he wasn&rsquo;t able to win either election or further spread his ideas a decade or so into the 1900s, this was another setback for the movement.</li>
<li>Although Sun Yat-Sen was a Georgist who became the first head of state of the Republic of China in 1911, Yuan Shikai became the new head of state, failed to reinstate monarchy in China, abdicated, and died, thus causing China to become fragmented into being controlled by warlords from 1916 to 1928. Sun Yat-Sen died in 1925, Communists took control of some parts of China during the Warlord Era, and Chiang Kai-Shek started oppressing democracy and paying lip service to Sun&rsquo;s ideals. So although the Kuomintang was initially a Georgist party when it first ruled and was first led by a Georgist, Georgism never took hold in China due to an unfortunate sequence of events. This is even more unfortunate when it can be considered that the nationwide implementation of Georgism in China could&rsquo;ve dissuaded people from aiding the eventual Communist takeover, which would&rsquo;ve changed the entire course of China&rsquo;s history for the better compared to today.</li>
<li>If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_Gaffney">Mason Gaffney</a>&rsquo;s position is to be believed, rich land barons like Leland Stanford funded the first economics departments at US universities and staffed them with avowed anti-Georgists, who created neoclassical economics with the express purpose of rewriting all of economics terminology to confound Georgist arguments and erase Henry George from history. Unfortunately, they succeeded. This is explained in more detail in this excerpt from Gaffney&rsquo;s book: <a href="https://www.masongaffney.org/publications/K1Neo-classical_Stratagem.CV.pdf">Neo-Classical Strategem As A Strategy Against Henry George</a>. Not only that, but <a href="../index.html#fake-research">Academia in general has been corrupted by a filter bubble of its own</a>.</li>
<li>High school students tend to be taught Keynesian Economics and Supply-Side Economics. Georgism is never mentioned at all in high school history and economics textbooks, and not even most college economics textbooks for that matter since academia has been compromised.</li>
<li>Georgism is not intuitive enough for the general public to understand, nor does it evoke the emotions necessary for catching people&rsquo;s attention and dawning activism. For the most part, it benefits everyone equally, so there is no special interest group to put money into promoting it. Georgism is not messianic, so it lacks the quasi-religious appeal of Marxism and &rsquo;the end of history&rsquo;. To top it off, Georgism confronts the notion of private property in land, a system so deeply entrenched into modern culture that most people will never even conceive that there might be an alternative to it. Memes and cultures evolved to think about labor and &ldquo;investments&rdquo;, not land.</li>
<li>Nowadays, there are hardly any famous Georgist advocates and intellectuals who are bringing the idea into the public&rsquo;s eye. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism#Lists_of_Georgists">Nearly all the famous Georgists noted in the Georgism Wikipedia article</a> are dead. Nowadays, people are massively divided by filter bubbles, especially due to the rise of the internet and increased political polarization. Most people have never heard of Georgism, and most of those who have heard of it don&rsquo;t understand it. On top of all that, there are no major news outlets that publish ideas and arguments to promote Georgism among the public.</li>

<h2 id="repopularizing-georgism"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Ideas For Re-Popularizing Georgism</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-repopularizing-georgism">
<p>
Georgism was popular once, and it can be popular again. The modern era has exhausted both its solutions and its revolutions, and people are beginning to look for ways to fix the problems unfolding in front of them.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The growing popularity of the FIRE Movement could help to counteract people&rsquo;s opposition to Georgism. Since the FIRE Movement aims to help people build up all their retirement savings earlier in life so they can retire at earlier ages, say in their 30s or 40s, this could help people become less reliant on owning homes as part of their retirement plan since it wouldn&rsquo;t be as practical to buy a home when young and watch its land value increase until the homeowner sells it to make up a huge chunk of their retirement plan.</li>
<li>People who support supply-side economics might be some of the easiest people to convert to Georgist economics. The Laffer Curve assumes that the government has to be funded by a tax that decreases economic output, but this is made obsolete since <a href="../economics/georgism-elevator-pitch.html#benefits-list">collecting Land Value Tax instead would not decrease economic output</a>. On r/neoliberal, almost all of the users there support Georgism, so we know that they are some of the people who are already the most receptive to this idea.</li>
<li>Worsening housing and rent problems in California, Idaho, major metropolitan areas, Japan, China, and other places that are facing housing shortages could also ignite support for Georgism. The key will be to market it as <a href="../economics/georgism-elevator-pitch.html#affordable-housing">the best solution to the housing crises</a>.</li>
<li>Restructuring urban planning to be more walkable and less reliant on to cars would help, but this would take decades, at which point, cars would be both electric-powered and self-driving.</li>
<li>Educating people about economics. Although Georgism may not be intuitive, we can still try to recruit people who wade great influence to help promote it, like educational Youtube channels that have millions of subscribers.</li>
<li>Educating people about <a href="../epistemology/3-understanding-evolution.html#biorealism-external-links">Biological Realism</a>. In my personal experience, when people <a href="../FAQs/overpopulation-FAQs.html">fully understand population dynamics</a>, they tend to be more supportive of Georgism. This is because there is a surprisingly coherent and interesting <a href="../economics/georgism-EPC-connection.html">Connection between Georgism and Population Control</a>, since both concepts aim to conserve resources and deal with natural resources that exist in fixed supply.</li>
<li><a href="../epistemology/difficult-to-change-peoples-minds.html">Understanding Why It&rsquo;s So Difficult To Change People&rsquo;s Minds</a>. In order to change other people&rsquo;s minds, we have to first understand epistemology, belief networks, social dynamics, and much more.</li>
