NOTE: Much of this essay is a summary of <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-case-against-ubi.html?view=classic">Blithering Genius&rsquo;s Essay on UBI</a>, but with my own commentary critiques added in, and my reasoning addressing how many of the problems with UBI could be avoided if it were funded by Land Value Tax instead. I then propose alternatives for spending the excess LVT revenues, instead of using UBI.
</p>

<p>
NOTE: I will have to edit the file first to make sure that I quote BG correctly to separate his essay&rsquo;s text from my own commentary, before I can publish the bulk of this essay.

<div id="outline-container-LVT-eliminates-COLAs" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="LVT-eliminates-COLAs"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> LVT Would Eliminate The Need For COLAs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-LVT-eliminates-COLAs">
<p>
If UBI is funded without LVT, it would have to vary depending on location, and production will plummet, among other problems.
</p>

<p>
COLA: Cost-of-Living Adjustment
</p>

<p>
LVT would eliminate the question whether UBI would increase rent or not. It is a proven economic theorem that Land Value Taxes cannot be passed onto the tenants. Since LVT would not punish landlords for building more housing, the end result is that rents go down since property taxes are eliminated. Rents would decrease even further as the supply of housing increases since landlords would be incentivized to build more housing, since they would be able to build as much housing as they like without having to worry about increasing tax rates.
</p>

<p>
Since Land Value Tax would decrease the cost of rent, the cost of living would also vary less by location, as housing would become more affordable regardless of whether it&rsquo;s a city or a rural area. This solves yet another problem relating to UBI since there would be less necessary to provide differing UBIs depending on the recipient&rsquo;s place of residence and the associated COLAs.
</p>

<p>
UBI would offer people more liquidity to move out of a high-rent area into a lower-rent area since it costs money to move from one place to another, especially if they&rsquo;re living paycheck to paycheck and would have to take a few days off work in order to move all their belongings into a low-rent area. In theory, UBI would eliminate the need for them to take out a loan in order to afford to move out of their high-rent apartments and what not.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-LVT-doesnt-reduce-production" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="LVT-doesnt-reduce-production"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> LVT Doesn&rsquo;t Harm Production, Unlike Other Taxes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-LVT-doesnt-reduce-production">
<p>
Funding UBI with LVT would also reduce the decrease in production that UBI would cause, since land value taxes do not punish people for doing labor.
</p>

<p>
I don&rsquo;t think I support UBI, but I will say that if UBI is ever going to work, then it needs to be funded by Land Value Tax, and there needs to be Eugenic Population Control in place, lest it only accelerate the collapse of modern civilization.

<div id="outline-container-LVT-EPC-UBI-rebuttal-to-criticisms" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="LVT-EPC-UBI-rebuttal-to-criticisms"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Invalid Criticisms Against LVT-Funded UBI With EPC</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-LVT-EPC-UBI-rebuttal-to-criticisms">
<blockquote>
<p>
A UBI for say, $1000/month would have to come from somewhere, either from taxation or money printing. The person who imagined that he would be $1000 richer might find himself $1000 poorer in actual spending power.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If UBI is funded by Land Value Tax, the GDP of the economy won&rsquo;t be reduced by taxes since LVT doesn&rsquo;t tax production. Likewise, inflation is unlikely since no new money would be printed to fund the UBI.</li>
<li>However, UBI would still make the economy less productive because it would reduce the incentive for <i>all</i> individuals to work.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
Different UBIs would be needed to adjust for different costs of living at different locations.
</p>
</blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Since Georgism would make living in cities more affordable by encouraging landlords to build more housing, as well as more dense housing, while not having to pay property taxes and being unable to pass LVT onto the tenants, a Georgist UBI faces one less consequence that a non-Georgist UBI faces, i.e. the cost of living varies greatly by location, so a UBI in Manhattan may not be the same as a UBI received in the rural Western states. When Georgism makes housing more affordable in both cities and rural areas, there is much less of a need to provide differing UBIs depending on the recipient&rsquo;s place of residence.</li>
<li>If a reproductive license and tax are required to have children, society would need less welfare in general, and this would leave one less thing for UBI to potentially exacerbate or fail to fix.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-post-peak-idea-production" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="post-peak-idea-production"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> UBI In A World That Has Passed Peak Idea Production</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-post-peak-idea-production">
<p>
Although Proponents of UBI claim that people would be more free to pursue creative and intellectual endeavors if they were able to work less, this ignores the fact that we&rsquo;ve already surpassed Peak Idea Production: <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/01/are-we-running-out-of-ideas.html">Why We Are Running Out Of Good Ideas</a>. Since there is probably only a finite amount of new ideas that can be conceived in this world, this is a good point for arguing that UBI wouldn&rsquo;t do much to improve society.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-UBI-alternatives" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="UBI-alternatives"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Possibly Better Alternatives To UBI</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-UBI-alternatives">
<p>
If there is a surplus of government revenue after all LVT is collected, then we may need to find better ways to spend the excess revenue than UBI.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The most basic functions of government: law enforcement, court system, military, border patrol, coast guard, foreign affairs, fire departments, emergency services, etc</li>
<li>Hard infrastructure: roads, railways, bridges, tunnels, water supply, sewers, electrical grids, and telecommunications (including Internet connectivity and broadband access).</li>
<li>Soft infrastructure: educational programs, official statistics, parks and recreational facilities, etc.</li>
<li>K-12 Education?</li>
<li>Single-Payer Healthcare?</li>
<li>Singapore&rsquo;s Welfare System, plus some amount of LBI?</li>
<li>Laborers&rsquo; Bonus Income (LBI)?: Laborers who work are paid LVT by the government for working. A percentage of the worker&rsquo;s salary (as determined by the government) is paid in addition to whatever the worker is paid by the employer.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-LBI" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="LBI"><span class="section-number-3">5.1.</span> Laborers&rsquo; Bonus Income (LBI)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-LBI">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Laborers&rsquo; Bonus Income (LBI): Laborers who work are paid LVT by the government for working.</li>
<li>This would have all the benefits of Land Value Tax (no land speculation, more efficient land usage, no taxation on production, affordable housing, reduced pollution, no land monopolies, reduced wealth inequality, etc),</li>
<li>Not only that, but it also wouldn&rsquo;t suffer the drawbacks of UBI (decreased incentive to work, decreased production, weakened male-female pair bond, weakened parent-child relationships, etc.</li>
<li>Since workers wouldn&rsquo;t pay any income taxes, they would be incentivized to work more.</li>
<li>However, since workers also would receive money from the LVT-funded LBI just by the virtue of working, this might cancel out the benefits of abolishing income taxes, since workers would have to work less to make a living and save for retirement.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People will work more if they get paid more, since getting paid more provides an increased incentive to work. However, for people doing FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early), most of them will only work up to a certain point once they have reached their target savings and investment. If they reach their targeted savings amount after working fewer hours under LBI instead of however many more hours that they would work without LBI, then they would work less overall.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>However, it should also be considered that earning more money for the same amount of work would enable them to live less frugally and more lavishly during the years that they are working, which would partially counter-balance the lower amount of work that they would be doing due to receiving an LBI.</li>
<li>Additionally, even if LBI enables FIRE-movement laborers to retire earlier, those laborers would have to save up some additional money for the additional retirement years that they will be able to have, which would also partially counter-balance the fewer working hours made possible by LBI.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In a country where over 50% of employees live paycheck-to-paycheck, LBI would definitely increase those workers&rsquo; disposable incomes, reverse declining fertility rates, and allow the workers to retire earlier. This is far better than what we have now, and the other negative consequences of our Anti-Georgist economic system.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On the bright side, since there would be a significantly reduced welfare state, and the LVT revenue would not be paid to people who don&rsquo;t work, LBI would not subsidize people who don&rsquo;t want to work at all.</li>
