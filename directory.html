	<h1>Zero Contradictions Philosophy - Directory</h1>
	<p>
		<img src="images/ZC-emblem.svg" alt="Zero Contradictions Emblem">
		Hello and welcome to my philosophy website.
		My name is Zero Contradictions, and this place is a hybrid between a blog for my own writings <span style="color:#EE0534">(highlighted in red)</span> and a compendium of external links to works by different authors that have influenced my own philosophy and/or are worth reading <span style="color:#015EF4">(highlighted in blue)</span> as well as links to videos, channels, or audio recordings <span style="color:#009C00">(highlighted in green)</span>.
		If you click one of the links in the navigation bar, then the page will scroll down to that section (which will be in one of the three columns for displays that are at least 800 pixels wide).
		Whether this site displays in light or dark mode depends on your web browser preferences.
		<br>
		Unlike <a class="ZC-essays" href="/">the homepage</a>, this directory page only lists my own essays and works, as well as a handful of other works that are hosted directly on this site.
		The number of asterisks (***) inside each link (if any) indicates what I personally consider to be my most original or most important works. I'm more proud of those pages than others.
		<br>
		If you want to report any typos or broken links, ask questions, give constructive criticism, make volunteer translations, suggest links to add to this home page, or make a donation, please reach out to me at <a class="ZC-essays" href="misc/contact#contact-ZC">my contact page</a>.
		As per its name, the goal of this website is to create the most rational philosophy ever with Zero Contradictions, or to at least do my best at that.
		In a single sentence, my philosophy is based on rationalism and understanding the implications of the subject-object dichotomy and applied evolutionary theory, among other things.

	<li><a class="ZC-essays" href="faqs/overpopulation">Overpopulation and Demographic Transition Theory FAQs ***</a>
		<p>The only ways to avoid overpopulation are mass death or low birth rates (population control). Overpopulation is otherwise inevitable. Once there's overpopulation, it's game over for civilization.</p></li>

	<li><a class="ZC-essays" href="epistemology/academia-critique">A Rational Critique Of Academic Research ***</a>
		<p>This sequel essay elaborates on the causes of fake academic research and other types of unproductive research: plagiarized, redundant, out-dated, and useless. My solutions for fixing academia are to require a minimum age, overhaul funding with a bounty system, and an improved social structure for organizing research, among other things.</p></li>

	<li><a class="ZC-essays" href="epistemology/evolution">Evolution And Its Implications **</a>
		<p>Some musings about evolution, memetics, and biology. All the thoughts in this file are grouped together under one page because I didn't have enough to say to make them separate posts in their own right.</p></li>
	<li><a class="ZC-essays" href="epistemology/determinism">Determinism and Physicalism *</a>
		<p>Free Will and Determinism are best understood via subject-object compatibilism, spatio-temporal envelopes, chaos theory, and materialism / physicalism. Multiple definitions and arguments are given to clarify the main misunderstandings and implications of physicalism.</p></li>

	<li><p>Originally, I wrote most of these epistemology pages as I was trying to form and write my own understanding of epistemology, independently of other people as a young college student in his early 20s.
			Discovering Blithering Genius's content caused my theory of epistemology to fundamentally and substantially change.
			I had already put in so much effort in trying to theorize and write about epistemology, but I also didn't want to display my ideas that I no longer endorse, so I edited all these pages to reflect a more accurate and complete understanding of epistemology.
			As a consequence, many of the ideas presented on these pages are not original ideas that I thought of by myself, but I consider the pages with more asterisks next to them to be more original and unique from other people's works.</p></li>
	<li><p>If it is confusing to read and navigate any of the epistemology pages, it's due to how they were created, and since I now mostly lack the desire to edit or improve them much further.
			I don't think it will be worthwhile to expand or finish writing most of these pages since my understanding is still subject to change, and since I think Blithering Genius's next philosophy book will probably be substantially more comprehensive and better written than anything displayed here.
			Nevertheless, if anybody wants to read these pages anyway, they are free to do so.
			Every reader should understand that it's better to recognize these pages as collections of thoughts of varying quality and originality, as indicated by the asterisks.</p></li>

<ul>
	<li><a class="ZC-essays" href="civilization/wokism">A Rational Analysis of Wokism ***</a>
		<p>This page features a response to <a href="https://ncofnas.com/p/why-we-need-to-talk-about-the-rights">Why We Need to Talk about the Right's Stupidity Problem</a> by Nathan Cofnas. It goes on to talk about the origins and rise of wokism, the nature of discrimination, the origin of <del>diversity</del> equal representation, racial "oppression", transgender people, etc.</p></li>
	<li><a class="ZC-essays" href="misc/nathan-cofnas-emails">Responding To Nathan Cofnas's Email Response ***</a>
		<p> Wokism is motivated by emotions, mental gymnastics, and propaganda more than anything else. It's absurd to believe that wokism is driven by rationality. The justifications for systemic racism and demographics quotas have irreconcilable contradictions. The cultural hypothesis is more reasonable than wokism.<p></li>
	<li><a class="ZC-essays" href="civilization/technology">Technology and Civilization ***</a>
		<p>This page lists the main problems that are caused by increasing or adopting new technologies, as well as my thoughts on AI, peak technology, and speculations about the collapse of modern civilization.<p></li>
	<li><a class="ZC-essays" href="civilization/climate-change">Climate Change And Global Warming ***</a>
		<p>This analysis compares climate change with overpopulation, pollution, and other environmental problems. Climate activism is moralized, ineffective, and counter-productive. To solve environmental issues, we'll need to reduce fossil fuel consumption, switch to nuclear energy, tax natural resources, and reduce population growth.</p></li>
	<li><a class="ZC-essays" href="civilization/democracy">Thoughts on Democracy ***</a>
		<p>Democracy exists to enable societal compromises. My proposal is to overhaul it with a system that emphasizes meritocracy and sortition. This page also analyzes other reforms to democracy, First-Past-The-Post (FPTP), parliaments vs presidencies, different democratic procedures, redrawing state boundaries, and big tent strategy.</p></li>

		<p>Libertarianism is unsustainable, incompatible with human nature, and it fails to understand what freedom is and why/when it's desirable.</p></li>
	<li><a class="ZC-essays" href="civilization/political-philosophy">Political Philosophy: Defining An Ideal Government *</a>
		<p>Some musings for defining an ideal government's political philosophy and legal code, and the best solutions to the game-theoretic problems that every society must face.</p></li>
	<li><a class="ZC-essays" href="civilization/geopolitics">Thoughts on Geopolitics *</a>
		<p>Some musings about geopolitics that follow some basic principles and observed history. All competition ultimately stems from competition for scarce natural resources. Defense, law, and order are the first duties of a state.  Geography shapes the battlefield. Peace can only be secured by preparing for war.</p></li>

	<li><a class="ZC-essays" href="language/morphological-typology">A Better Way To Think About Morphological Typology *</a>
		<p>The traditional system for classifying language typology conflates many different morphological characteristics into a 1D or 2D spectrum that does not descriptively characterize language morphology.

		<p>The Georgism movement used to be fairly popular during the Progressive Era from the 1880s to 1920s. However, the rising dominance of the automobile, mortgage loans, Keynesianism, and the Cold War era Capitalism-Communism dichotomy all contributed to the decline of Georgist activism.
