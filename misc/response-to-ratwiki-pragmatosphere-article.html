RationalWiki, better known as &ldquo;RatWiki&rdquo;, is one of the more ironically named websites on the internet.
Essentially, it is an advocacy site that defends secular humanist dogmas and attacks opposing views.
It is full of fallacies and lies.
There is nothing rational about it.
</p>

<p>
On Reddit, I had a long text debate with a reddit user named <a href="https://reddit.com/user/electric-gecko">u/Electric-Gecko</a> that lasted multiple months, but I had since deleted all the comments that I wrote in response to his replies for a few reasons: 1. He tried to report me to the r/Georgism subreddit and Reddit for &ldquo;harassment&rdquo; since I was asking him to give a rebuttal(s) against my arguments, 2. I disclosed some personal information within them, and 3. I tend to do this habitually with most of my reddit comments.
I had already addressed many of the critiques written in his RatWiki articles during this text debate, but he ignored my responses and continued writing his own beliefs anyway.
</p>

<p>
Electric-Gecko eventually entered the Frogstar B discord server under false pretenses to continue debating the reality of race.
He later re-entered the server under two different fake identities: &ldquo;shieldmaiden&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thandojo&rdquo;.
Both times, he was instantly caught and suspected as being an alt account and fake persona of Electric-Gecko.
</p>


<p>
After he left under his Electric-Gecko account, he started writing a <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/11/response-to-my-ratwiki-entry.html">RatWiki article regarding Blithering Genius</a> and a <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/The_Pragmatosphere">second article about the Pragmatosphere</a> under his RatWiki username <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/User:LiamM32">LiamM32</a>.
Hence, I will refer to him as &ldquo;Liam&rdquo; for the rest of this article.
Keep in mind that wikis allow for multiple authors, and the entry could change after I write this.
The quotes were pulled at the time of writing.
</p>

<p>
Now let&rsquo;s get to the response.
</p>
<hr>

<blockquote>
<p>
[Zero Contradictions] appears to defend the (alleged) legitimacy of race more strongly than Blithering Genius, going as far as to call those who reject the construct &ldquo;race denialists&rdquo;.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It&rsquo;s misleading to call race a &ldquo;social construct&rdquo;, and that term is over-used in general.
<a href="https://zerocontradictions.net/FAQs/race-FAQs#race-is-biological-examples">Race has real biological and physiological properties</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
He seems to have learned a very bad lesson from the article &ldquo;Why Most Academic Research is Fake&rdquo;.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I was already skeptical of academic research before I discovered Blithering Genius&rsquo;s content.
LiamM32 / Electric Gecko has still never given a proper refutation to &ldquo;<a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/05/why-most-academic-research-is-fake.html">Why Most Academic Research is Fake</a>&rdquo;.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026; as he frequently cites racialist and white supremacist blogs for claims regarding human genetics.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It&rsquo;s usually the case that people are often right about some things and wrong about other things.
You have to use your best judgment for determining the truth.
If a person has reasonable, evidence-based views for X, Y, and Z, then I will high confidence when they talk about things relating to X, Y, and Z.
If a person has irrational, ideological views for A, B, and C, then I will have high skepticism when they talk about things relating to A, B, and C.
Generally speaking, it&rsquo;s just a bad idea to assume or side with someone else is right on <i>everything</i>, because there will almost certainly be <i>something</i> that any random person fails to understand correctly.
</p>

<p>
For Thuletide and Metapedia, I know that they have unreasonable oppositions against race-mixing, they believe in genetic tribalism despite how it&rsquo;s contrary to biological evidence, they fail to recognize that overpopulation is a huge problem, they are equally lazy in evaluating their assumptions and understanding epistemology, etc.
</p>

<p>
Thuletide has made mistakes in the past, like how he underestimated the average Ashkenazi IQ, but then he admitted that he was wrong about it and he corrected himself that 108 is a better estimate.
He also gatekeeps and says that Jews and hapas are not white.
It&rsquo;s a nuanced question, and it depends on the context.
I can tell when he&rsquo;s being ideological when I see it, but I usually trust most of what Thuletide claims regarding racial biology and genetics.
</p>

<p>
If I had all the time in the world, I would paraphrase and add in all the useful information from places like Metapedia, Thuletide, etc, and exclude all the white supremacist bullshit.
All of his work is in the public domain. Ideally, if I had all the time in the world, I would copy all of his work and rewrite it to have a more realist perspective on race and reality, instead of a racist white supremacist view.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In other instances of crankery, his homepage links to an (admittedly hilarious) Thuletide article on nofap.[note 1]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It&rsquo;s very telling how LiamM32 chose to focus on a random link on my homepage, while ignoring everything else on my website.
Liam isn&rsquo;t trying to make his RatWiki article representative of my philosophy and beliefs.
As he&rsquo;s stated on <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Talk:Blithering_Genius">the talk page for Blithering Genius&rsquo;s RatWiki article</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I&rsquo;m primarily writing this article for potential followers of him, not RationalWiki regulars.
I want it to be in the Google search results when people search him.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Unfortunately for Liam, this effort will likely backfire by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect">Streisanding</a> the popularity of Blithering Genius and the Pragmatosphere.
Creating links to pages written by Blithering Genius and other Pragmatosphere on RatWiki will only boost the SEO of the blog ring.
Conversely, it&rsquo;s unlikely to dissuade any potential followers because <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/07/status-pyramid-schemes.html">the number of believers for most ideologies is already predetermined</a>.
Most potential followers are already likely to either already be suspicious of RatWiki&rsquo;s ability to be accurate and impartial, or likely to figure out that they should distrust RatWiki to talk about anything relating to right-wing or biological realism topics.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In a FAQ page, he has a section on the Great Replacement, in which he fearmongers about white people disappearing.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The claim that I&rsquo;m &ldquo;fearmongering&rdquo; about white people disappearing does not refute anything that I&rsquo;ve said in my section on the <a href="https://zerocontradictions.net/FAQs/race-FAQs#great-replacement">Great Replacement</a>.
All demographic projections predict that the United States will no longer be &gt;50% white by 2045, and the share of whites in the US and other countries are projected to continue declining past the 50% point, unless some serious political, cultural, and demographic changes are made.
Purely white people may continue to exist in the future, but if they do, it&rsquo;s quite possible that they could eventually become as rare as whites in South Africa, or as uncommon as American Indians are in the United States.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
He then cites &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; from Thuletide of &ldquo;Anti-White Ideology And Propaganda In The West&rdquo;, none of which is convincing.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It&rsquo;s literally <i>everywhere</i>.
You could only miss it if you&rsquo;re blind in one eye, can&rsquo;t see out of the other.
When &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay to be white&rdquo; is labeled a hate slogan, I think we have a problem.
</p>

<p>
There were <i>hundreds</i> of media headlines and images displayed in that article, and they&rsquo;re only a <i>fraction</i> of <i>all</i> the anti-white headlines out there on the Internet.
They all try to prime the reader into accepting anti-white, pro-mass-immigration, pro-multiracial biases.
This is how subliminal messaging, <a href="../language/sapir-whorf-theory#classical-conditioning">classical conditioning</a>, and <a href="../language/sapir-whorf-theory#selective-attention">selective attention</a> all work.
</p>

<p>
Liam is deliberately refusing to acknowledge all the anti-white propaganda in the West for himself, and he&rsquo;s being bad-faith on this topic.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1670gha/how_many_neurotypical_friends_do_you_currently/">Liam has known and self-identified himself as being autistic ever since he was 11 years old</a>, so this may explain why he&rsquo;s been unable to understand the cultural implicature and anti-white biases present in society.
</p>

<p>
Supporting mass immigration counts as being anti-white.
Mass immigration exacerbates the <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#great-replacement">Great Replacement</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The second one &ldquo;with statistical evidence&rdquo; is laughably unscientific; it makes no use of control groups (which would be rather easy).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Tell me that you don&rsquo;t understand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_linguistics">corpus linguistics</a> without telling me that you don&rsquo;t understand corpus linguistics.
Control variables aren&rsquo;t supposed to be used in corpus linguistics.
One of the goals of corpus linguistics is to show which words that people are using the most, which reflects what people are thinking about the most.
A scientist wouldn&rsquo;t use control variables unless they were running an experiment and trying to test for a dependent variable.
In Thuletide&rsquo;s article, he&rsquo;s only displaying observational data.
He&rsquo;s not trying to test for anything (and how could he? you can&rsquo;t really &ldquo;test&rdquo; stuff that&rsquo;s already happened in the past), so there&rsquo;s no reason to use control variables.
The point of the article was to show that there was a large sudden increase in the media&rsquo;s focus on &ldquo;racism&rdquo;, &ldquo;white supremacy&rdquo;, &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo;, etc in the 2010s.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Finally, he has a section called &ldquo;Ideas For Boosting Western Fertility&rdquo;,[7] which is ironic given his claim that overpopulation will be &ldquo;basically game over for civilization&rdquo;, and that population control will be required to prevent it.[8]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
My section &ldquo;<a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#boosting-western-fertility">Ideas For Boosting Western Fertility</a>&rdquo; is not ironic.
I have a section in my <a href="../FAQs/overpopulation-FAQs#population-collapse">Overpopulation FAQs about why population collapse is a problem too</a>, so I&rsquo;m against both overpopulation and population collapse.
I wrote my ideas for boosting western fertility because I want humanity to achieve a stable, predictable, and sustainable population for the future.
Given the current <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#great-replacement">Great Replacement</a> of white people, boosting western fertility rates is especially important to help stop this from happening.
</p>




<blockquote>
<p>
Eternal Anglo: This is a much smaller blog than the others. It has interactive maps showing fertility rates by race in various western countries by region.[13] Why would anyone want that?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t collect data on X&rdquo; implies &ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t analyze X&rdquo;, which implies &ldquo;We should be ignorant about X&rdquo;.
Given that <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs">race has strong implications</a> regarding economic productivity, crime rates, diseases, etc, there are no reasons to <i>not</i> collect data regarding the fertility rates of different races.
As with everything political and everything that has conflicts of interest, it&rsquo;s important to have safeguards that prevent information from being abused.
