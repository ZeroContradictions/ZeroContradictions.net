<p>
I work on this website purely as a hobby and activist project.
I also don&rsquo;t make any money or advertisement revenue on this site, so I appreciate all donations that I receive for supporting my efforts.

<h2 id="free-rider-donations"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> The Free Rider Problem With Relying On Donations</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-free-rider-donations">
<p>
The free rider problem partially explains why content creators and service providers that rely on donations are less likely to make money.
For example, if a private security service for monitoring one&rsquo;s home provided everybody with free security, then no one would pay for it.
Everybody would just hope that someone else pays the company with sufficient money to help the company make a profit and continue affording to provide the service.
The free rider problem thus explains why people and companies have to charge money for the value that they provide.
</p>

<p>
While I could charge money for people to see the content on this site, I believe that doing so would conflict with the strong desire to spread ideas to as many people as possible.
I also find that many content creators who charge money for their content are also more likely to make sensationalist claims that are designed to appeal to people.
<a href="../epistemology/critique-of-academic-research#academia-minimum-age">I&rsquo;ve talked about and explained this on my academia page</a>, but the gist is that the desire to make money often conflicts with the desire to pursue the truth, and people often choose the former out of financial necessity.

<h2 id="no-comments-section"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Why This Blog Does Not Have A Comments Section</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-no-comments-section">
<p>
There are multiple reasons why this blog does not feature a comments section:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It would require extra web development and time to setup.</li>
<li>The comments could clutter up the webpages.</li>
<li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-advice-troll.html">Advice Trolls</a> may post too many comments.</li>
<li>Many blog comments wouldn&rsquo;t be very useful or thought-provoking. I&rsquo;ve seen some exceptions to this, and I think Youtube comments tend to be more interesting, but I&rsquo;ve also seen blogs where a majority of the posts don&rsquo;t have any comments at all. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to spend a lot of time designing a comment system if little to no people would use it.</li>
<li>On the other hand, if the blog is getting a lot of comments, then it&rsquo;s possible that I won&rsquo;t have the time and energy to respond to all of them.</li>
<li>IMO, there are other platforms out there that are better suited for intellectual discussions.</li>
<li><a href="../#FAQs">I have a list of FAQs pages that people can read instead to answer their questions</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Maybe I&rsquo;ll change my mind on this in the future, but for now, I have no plans to add a comments section to any of the pages on this website.
Until then, people can leave comments on the <a href="https://zerocontradictions.substack.com/p/bridge">bridge post of my Substack</a>, and I may respond to them.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
A creator can&rsquo;t always anticipate how people will interpret their works, because criticism is so open-ended.
It&rsquo;s very easy to be a critic, because they can <i>always</i> find <i>something</i> to criticize, especially if they&rsquo;re ideological and dishonest.
So, creators can&rsquo;t write for critics.
Not everything will satisfy (all) critics.
There&rsquo;s always an infinite number of criticisms that people can pose.
</p>

<p>
However, what I can do is to think about and anticipate the most common stumbling blocks.
The best I can do is to counter the most general criticisms that are worth addressing as best I can.
That is the purpose of the FAQs pages.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-FAQs-pages-are-best" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="FAQs-pages-are-best"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> The FAQs Pages Will Answer Most People&rsquo;s Questions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-FAQs-pages-are-best">
<p>
From what I&rsquo;ve seen on other blogs, I estimate that if this blog had a comments section, approximately half of the comments being made would be criticisms that simply haven&rsquo;t read enough of this blog&rsquo;s philosophy to understand why the criticisms are invalid.
I argue that it would be a waste of time to respond to such comments if the specific criticisms in question were already addressed elsewhere on the blog.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the main reason why those types of criticisms are made in the first place is because the counter-arguments to the criticisms are not easy enough to find before writing them.
This is one reason why I created several FAQs pages that I can redirect people to read for common questions/criticisms that someone is likely to make against this blog&rsquo;s philosophy.
</p>

<p>
The other reason I created the FAQs pages is that they&rsquo;re an effective introduction and persuasion tool.
I can recall that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@StosselTV/videos">John Stossel</a>&rsquo;s method of answering FAQs in his pro-Libertarianism videos were effective in persuading me to convert Libertarianism when I became a Libertarian (until <a href="../civilization/case-against-libertarianism">I eventually rejected it</a>).
And the Efilism Wiki&rsquo;s FAQs page was also persuasive for accepting the reasoning behind Efilism, until I saw through <a href="../misc/case-against-efilism">Efilism&rsquo;s fallacious reasoning and assumptions</a>.
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010802051226/http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/tma68/geo-faq.htm">first FAQs that I saw for Georgism</a> and other ideologies were also great introductions for getting to know those ideologies for the first time.
