I work on this website purely as a hobby and activist project.
I also don&rsquo;t make any money or advertisement revenue on this site, so I appreciate all donations that I receive for supporting my efforts.

<h2 id="no-comments-section"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Why This Blog Does Not Have A Comments Section</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-no-comments-section">
<p>
There are multiple reasons why this blog does not feature a comments section:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It would require extra web development and time to setup.</li>
<li>The comments could clutter up the webpages.</li>
<li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-advice-troll.html">Advice Trolls</a> may post too many comments.</li>
<li>Many blog comments wouldn&rsquo;t be very useful or thought-provoking. I&rsquo;ve seen some exceptions to this, and I think Youtube comments tend to be more interesting, but I&rsquo;ve also seen blogs where a majority of the posts don&rsquo;t have any comments at all. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to spend a lot of time designing a comment system if little to no people would use it.</li>
<li>On the other hand, if the blog is getting a lot of comments, then it&rsquo;s possible that I won&rsquo;t have the time and energy to respond to all of them.</li>
<li>IMO, there are other platforms out there that are better suited for intellectual discussions.</li>
<li><a href="../#FAQs">I have a list of FAQs pages that people can read instead to answer their questions</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Maybe I&rsquo;ll change my mind on this in the future, but for now, I have no plans to add a comments section to any of the pages on this website.
Until then, people can leave comments on the <a href="https://zerocontradictions.substack.com/p/bridge">bridge post of my Substack</a>, and I may respond to them.
</p>

<p>
A creator can&rsquo;t always anticipate how people will interpret their works, because criticism is so open-ended.
It&rsquo;s very easy to be a critic, because they can <i>always</i> find <i>something</i> to criticize, especially if they&rsquo;re ideological and dishonest.
So, creators can&rsquo;t write for critics.
Not everything will satisfy (all) critics.
There&rsquo;s always an infinite number of criticisms that people can pose.
</p>

<p>
However, what I can do is to think about and anticipate the most common stumbling blocks.
The best I can do is to counter the most general criticisms that are worth addressing as best I can.
That is the purpose of the FAQs pages.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-FAQs-pages-are-best" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="FAQs-pages-are-best"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> The FAQs Pages Will Answer Most People&rsquo;s Questions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-FAQs-pages-are-best">
<p>
From what I&rsquo;ve seen on other blogs, I estimate that if this blog had a comments section, approximately half of the comments being made would be criticisms that simply haven&rsquo;t read enough of this blog&rsquo;s philosophy to understand why the criticisms are invalid.
I argue that it would be a waste of time to respond to such comments if the specific criticisms in question were already addressed elsewhere on the blog.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the main reason why those types of criticisms are made in the first place is because the counter-arguments to the criticisms are not easy enough to find before writing them.
This is one reason why I created several FAQs pages that I can redirect people to read for common questions/criticisms that someone is likely to make against this blog&rsquo;s philosophy.
</p>

<p>
The other reason I created the FAQs pages is that they&rsquo;re an effective introduction and persuasion tool.
I can recall that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@StosselTV/videos">John Stossel</a>&rsquo;s method of answering FAQs in his pro-Libertarianism videos were effective in persuading me to convert Libertarianism when I became a Libertarian (until <a href="../civilization/case-against-libertarianism">I eventually rejected it</a>).
And the Efilism Wiki&rsquo;s FAQs page was also persuasive for accepting the reasoning behind Efilism, until I saw through <a href="../misc/case-against-efilism">Efilism&rsquo;s fallacious reasoning and assumptions</a>.
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010802051226/http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/tma68/geo-faq.htm">first FAQs that I saw for Georgism</a> and other ideologies were also great introductions for getting to know those ideologies for the first time.
