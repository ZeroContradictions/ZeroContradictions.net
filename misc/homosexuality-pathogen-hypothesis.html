<h2 id="intro"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
Many authors have previously suggested that pathogens may be a possible cause of homosexuality, including <a href="https://jaymans.wordpress.com/2014/02/26/greg-cochrans-gay-germ-hypothesis-an-exercise-in-the-power-of-germs/">Gregory Cochran</a> in 2000<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>,
Steve Sailer in 2003<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>,
Peter Frost in 2009<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>,
<a href="https://brittonicmemetics.wordpress.com/2023/08/01/bugs-and-rainbows/">Brittonic Memetics</a> in 2023,
and likely many others that I am unaware of.
Additionally, the pseudonymous youtube essayist &ldquo;<a href="https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/Blithering_Genius">Blithering Genius</a>&rdquo; has elaborated on the hypothesis perhaps most eloquently in his 2016 video, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGv-yNDdjZY">Sacculina</a>&rdquo;, and his 2023 essay &ldquo;<a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/11/parasites-emotions-and-identity.html">Parasites, Emotions, and Identity</a>&rdquo;.
This theory became viral on September 20, 2021, when an anonymous user on 4chan&rsquo;s <i>pol</i> posted a hypothesis<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>, which became informally known as the &ldquo;worm pill&rdquo;.<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
There is a cultural bias in the Modern West against viewing <a href="https://www.emilkirkegaard.com/p/homosexuality-is-a-mental-illness">homosexuality as a disorder</a>, so there&rsquo;s also biases on research into possible causes.
This essay is an exploration into the pathogen hypothesis for male homosexuality.
As of now, we are reserving judgment on other speculative effects of pathogen infection, those being motivation to engage in other forms of abnormal sexual behavior: transsexualism, bestiality, etc.
</p>

<p>
Note that female homosexuality likely has different causes from male homosexuality.
The evidence for the pathogen hypothesis doesn&rsquo;t fit as well for female homosexuality.
We know that female same-sex-attraction is more continuously distributed along the Kinsey scale, compared to male same-sex-attraction.
There is also no evidence that <a href="#other-causes">other proposed causes of male homosexuality</a> apply to female homosexuals.
Some biologists have speculated that female homosexuality is a <a href="https://jaymans.wordpress.com/2012/10/28/the-evolution-of-female-bisexuality/">by-product of genetic selection</a>.
Some have even argued that <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/24028378_What_is_Sexual_Orientation_and_Do_Women_Have_One">most women don&rsquo;t have a sexual orientation</a>.
In any case, female homosexuality is not the focus of this essay.

<p>
There are known examples of similar phenomena that occur in the wild.
A parasite called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacculina">Sacculina</a> infects a male crab by attaching to its genitals and giving it hormones to make it behave like a female crab.
It then causes the male crab to nurse the Sacculina&rsquo;s eggs.
The parasite reproduces and the cycle continues.
A more commonly known example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii">Toxoplasma Gondii</a>.
These parasites reproduce in the intestines of cats and lay eggs in the cat&rsquo;s feces.
They then spread to other intermediary hosts such as rodents.
The parasite infects and modifies the behavior of rodents to make them attracted to cats, rather than fearful of them.
The cat then eats the infected rodent, and Toxoplasma Gondii is able to reproduce again.
These are well established examples of parasites exploiting another organism&rsquo;s form for their own benefit.
</p>


<p>
All STDs are caused by pathogens.
Virtually every STD is orders of magnitude more prevalent among Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM) than it is among the general population.
We&rsquo;re not claiming that there are known STDs that make people gay, but this does demonstrate that pathogens do spread better among homosexual men than other populations.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-human-psychology">
<p>
Furthermore, most people are disgusted by homosexual intercourse and sexual promiscuity.
This instinct (commonly labeled &ldquo;homophobia&rdquo;) is part of the immune system, and is usually reserved towards disease and infection vectors that humans have been exposed to for millennia, such as decaying organisms, insects, arachnids, fecal matter, etc.
This natural instinct is so strong that cultures and religions have evolved explicit values and policies against homosexuality (e.g. Islam and Christianity).
Similar religious policies include the banning of certain kinds of food, or unsafe preparation methods to limit the spread of disease.
In homosexuals, the disgust response towards homosexual intercourse is gone, despite the high risk of catching a multitude of diseases that reside in fecal matter and may be transmitted via anal sex.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, homosexual men tend to be more sexually promiscuous relative to normal people.
They tend to have sex more often and with far more partners.
These facts are consistent with the pathogen hypothesis because an intestinal pathogen would be able to spread itself to more hosts if its current hosts engage in frequent anal sex.
These behavior patterns are also consistent with the disgust response in homosexuals being suppressed by something.
It could be that this specific yet simple behavioral effect happens to be good at propagating pathogens.

<h3 id="abnormal-sexual-behaviors"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Abnormal Sexual Behavior</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-abnormal-sexual-behaviors">
<p>
Pedophilia is another behavior that is more common among the homosexual population than the heterosexual population.
&ldquo;A study in the Journal of Sex Research found that although heterosexuals outnumber homosexuals by a ratio of at least 20 to 1, homosexual pedophiles commit about one-third of the total number of child sex offenses&rdquo; (Dailey)<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup>.
This disparity fits the hypothesis, because it would be advantageous for pathogens to infect their hosts as early as possible if they rely on psychologically modifying their hosts.
The younger the host, the more plastic the brain will be.
Pathogens are thus motivated to cause their hosts to engage in sexual intercourse with young children and younger men.

<div id="outline-container-evolutionary-reasoning" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="evolutionary-reasoning"><span class="section-number-3">2.4.</span> Evolutionary Reasoning</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-evolutionary-reasoning">
<p>
Above all, the primary evidence for the pathogen hypothesis is homosexuality itself.
<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/sex-couples-census-data-trickles-quarter-raising-children/story?id=13850332">Over 75% of homosexual couples don&rsquo;t raise any children at all</a>.
Since homosexuals don&rsquo;t reproduce nearly as much as heterosexuals, the condition is unlikely to be hereditary.
If it were, then it would select against itself and be an evolutionary dead end.
Instead, the condition is present in more than 1% of the male human population.
This implies that most cases of homosexuality are caused by environmental factors, not genes.
It&rsquo;s thus the prevalence of homosexuality that requires explanation.
We have yet to find any precise causal pathway to explain homosexuality, so we should prioritize investigating theories that could explain a prevalent maladaptive behavioral pattern.
If a reproducing machine is doing something other than reproducing, we should suspect the involvement of a pathogen that has captured the machine.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Just because we evolved to have particular functions, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that these functions can&rsquo;t be heavily changed by environment.
For example, we evolve to walk upright.
We are descendants of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus">homo erectus</a>, or upright man.
In spite of this however, there are instances of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_child">feral children</a> for example who were raised in wolf packs and other unnatural, atypical environments who instinctively walk on all fours.
It&rsquo;s what feels natural for them, since it&rsquo;s what they were taught at a young age.
They struggle for the rest of their lives to walk upright when they enter human society, and when people attempt to teach them to walk upright.
This does not negate the fact that human beings are meant to walk upright, as it&rsquo;s what we evolve to do.
</p>

<p>
The same can be said for how sexuality.
Heterosexuality is an innate aspect to human beings that we evolved to have.
Just as humans evolved to walk upright, humans evolved to be heterosexual.
If homosexuality is an environmentally-caused behavior, then it ought to be corrected.

<p>
None of the <a href="#other-causes">other theoretical causes of male homosexuality</a> have any evolutionary reasoning to back them up or explain why homosexuality has continued to exist despite being maladaptive, which makes all of them unlikely.
Since homosexuality is maladaptive, anything that causes it would be selected against by evolution, unless the cause is another reproducer of some sort.
The pathogen hypothesis proposes that a pathogen evolved to cause male homosexuality, so it&rsquo;s the <i>only</i> hypothesis that is compatible with evolutionary theory.

<p>
We would have already noticed a gay germ if there was one.
</p>

</div>
<p>
On that basis, it&rsquo;s somewhat unlikely to be a <i>known</i> pathogen.
As far as I know, nobody is looking for a correlation between homosexuality and pathogens.
I&rsquo;ve never seen an epidemiological study of homosexuality (please <a href="../misc/contact#contact-ZC">contact me</a> if there has been one).
It could also be that the pathogen is something that most people have evolved resistance against.
</p>

<p>
To clarify, we&rsquo;re not claiming that a <i>known</i> STD is the cause.
We are hypothesizing that an <i>unknown</i> pathogen is the cause.
It took a long time to connect ulcers to bacteria.
In general, it can take a long time to identify a pathogen, even if you suspect one.
It will be interesting if we ever do.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, if the argument is that the germ hypothesis is false because we haven&rsquo;t found the germ, then that would apply to every hypothesis since they have all failed to have found a specific causal mechanism yet.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="orgb37c3f1">
<p>
But if the pathogen transmits itself through anal intercourse, then why would it limit its host population to men? Women can receive anal intercourse too.
</p>

</div>
<p>
Women may be another vector of transmission, but male-on-male sex is still a more efficient channel of transmission overall, compared to transmitting male to female or female to female.
Males tend to higher sex drives and they have phalluses that make it easier for newly infected hosts to spread the pathogen to other hosts via anal intercourse.
Males thus require less modification than females for becoming viable hosts to pathogens.
The higher prevalence of STDs among MSM also suggests that homosexual men would make better hosts for such a pathogen to procreate and multiply.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="orge14ee3d">
<p>
If the hypothesis was valid, one should observe an increase in risk of becoming homosexual after an infection with a pathogen.
Such a relationship is not observed.
</p>

</div>
<p>
Perhaps, but since we&rsquo;re hypothesizing that male homosexuality may be caused by an <i>unknown</i> pathogen, we can&rsquo;t analyze a correlation unless we identify the pathogen to begin with.
Also, given that the development of sexuality occurs later in life, it&rsquo;s possible that pubescent or prepubescent parasitic infections are the reason why we don&rsquo;t observe this relationship.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="org837f668">
<p>
Homosexuals who are attracted to minors are typically interested in teenagers, not prepubescent children.
</p>

</div>
<p>
This does not refute the pathogen hypothesis because the adolescent brain is still developing and is more pliable than an adult one.
Adolescent brains are also within the typical age range for when humans start to develop sexual attraction, so teenagers may have the most optimal brains for parasitic modification and re-wiring among all other potential hosts.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="org3e9d229">
<p>
Are there other ways for the pathogen(s) to spread, besides anal intercourse?
</p>

</div>
<p>
If there is a pathogen, it&rsquo;s possible or even likely that it can be transmitted in other ways besides anal sex, but more research would be needed to determine what other infection vectors may be viable.
Given the evidence, it&rsquo;s reasonable to assume that homosexuality is ancient, widespread and maladaptive, but each of these assumptions can be disputed.

<h3 id="hormone-hypothesis"><span class="section-number-3">4.1.</span> The Prenatal Hormones Hypothesis</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-hormone-hypothesis">
<p>
There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_and_sexual_orientation">other documented and proposed causes of homosexuality</a>, and there is a consensus that hormones are involved in sexuality.
Homosexuality is known to be associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_hormones_and_sexual_orientation">abnormal prenatal hormone levels</a> during crucial neurological development periods (Sheppard)<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8" role="doc-backlink">8</a></sup> and (Wilson)<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup>.
This may be a separate cause of male homosexuality, but if so, then it&rsquo;s assuming that a key human reproductive function has been causing 2 to 5% of males to have significantly less offspring without it being selected out.
</p>

<p>
No one claims that evolutionary theory alone is sufficient to explain everything about human behavior or disorders, but evolutionary theory constrains any such explanation.
If a proposed mechanism assumes natural selection somehow stopped acting with respect to this trait for hundreds of generations, then it is probably false.
The hormonal imbalance hypothesis also cherry-picks its own evidence, since it ignores research about how homeostasis is hard to knock out of equilibrium in key reproductive functions.
The hormonal imbalance hypothesis is thus not a solid explanation for male homosexuality because its premises are not consistent with evolutionary theory or physiology.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s also possible that the hormonal imbalance hypothesis could be connected to the pathogen hypothesis, since there are known pathogens that control sexual development by secreting hormones (e.g. Sacculina), and also since people typically inherit their gut flora from their mothers during birth.
Gut flora could affect the prenatal environment, the mother&rsquo;s immune system, or hormones in the mother&rsquo;s blood.
If there is a connection between these two hypotheses, then the hormonal imbalance hypothesis would be consistent with evolutionary theory.

<div id="outline-container-gay-uncle-older-brother" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="gay-uncle-older-brother"><span class="section-number-3">4.2.</span> The Gay Uncle and the Older Brother</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-gay-uncle-older-brother">
<p>
Another possible cause is having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternal_birth_order_and_male_sexual_orientation">multiple older brothers</a>, which can cause an immune response or an allergic reaction in the womb that turns male fetuses homosexual.
The mechanism is thought to be a maternal immune response to male fetuses, whereby antibodies neutralize male Y-proteins that are thought to play a role in sexual differentiation during development.<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10" role="doc-backlink">10</a></sup>
Some estimates say that fraternal birth order causes homosexuality in at least one-sixth of all homosexual men.
But once again, this hypothesis also fails to explain why homosexuality has persisted without its causes being selected out of the gene pool, i.e. genetic factors that contribute to the immune response in the mother&rsquo;s womb.
</p>

<p>
The validity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology_and_sexual_orientation#Gay_uncle_hypothesis">the Gay Uncle Hypothesis</a> depends on the validity of kin selection theory.
While it is true that some homosexuals do adopt children, the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/sex-couples-census-data-trickles-quarter-raising-children/story?id=13850332">2010 US Census shows that about ~80% of children raised by homosexuals are the biological offspring of one of the homosexual partners</a>.
Homosexual men are also far less likely to have biological children than homosexual women.
There&rsquo;s also no widespread evidence of gay uncles caring for their nieces and nephews, among humans or in nature.
More generally, <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/07/kin-selection-theory-is-wrong.html">kin selection theory is based on fallacious reasoning</a>, so it should be rejected in favor of the <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/11/debunking-selfish-gene.html">phenocentric theory of biological purpose</a>.
And even if kin selection theory were true, it&rsquo;d make more sense for homosexuals to be asexual instead, since investing in a relationship would take away time and resources that could instead be invested towards nieces and nephews.
We can thus reject the Gay Uncle Hypothesis since there is no sound reasoning to support it.

<p>
George Francis has written an article <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240525183107/https://georgefrancis.substack.com/p/genetics-versus-gay-germ-theory">arguing that data from Genome-Wide Association (GWA) studies suggests that antagonistic pleiotropy is a more likely cause of homosexuality</a>.
It&rsquo;s worth reading, and it seems to be more likely than the other proposed causes.
</p>



<p>
Cultural factors may also have some impact on people&rsquo;s sexualities.
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240910044559/https://georgefrancis.substack.com/p/are-we-turning-the-kids-gay">George Francis has written another article investigating this topic</a>.
Historically, left-handedness used to be considered taboo and superstitious.
Left-handed people would often be violently punished if they used their left hand to write or whatever, so they learned to use their right hand.
&ldquo;Real&rdquo; left-handedness, was seen as extremely rare and a minor thing that wasn&rsquo;t significant at all.
When it became socially acceptable to be left-handed, the rate of left-handedness skyrocketed.
This is similar to how the rate of homosexuality skyrocketed as it became more acceptable.
With this considered, it could be that there&rsquo;s a large segment of the population that is homosexual and/or bisexual to some degree, and that it has only been suppressed by strong social pressure.
In which case, only those who were the most unavoidably non-hetero actually acted on it, since the consequences were so severe.
As society changes and adjusts, it becomes more and more acceptable, and the degree to which someone has to be non-hetero to embrace their sexuality goes down.
A feedback loop of acceptance and normalization then occurs.
</p>


<p>
If we know that there are multiple causes of male homosexuality, then homosexuals could be separated into two groups if the pathogen hypothesis is true: 1. those who have been infected with pathogens, and 2. those who have not.
If a large fraction of homosexuals are not affected by the pathogen, then future research could investigate the ratio of pathogen-infected homosexuals who did pedophilia vs non-pathogen-infected homosexuals who did pedophilia, and that could reveal more information about the strong correlation between homosexuality and pedophilia.
</p>

<p>
Some people may say that the pathogen hypothesis is too unlikely to have any possibility of being true.
But given <a href="#evidence">all the facts that we have stated about homosexuality</a> and how humanity has been so unable to figure out all the factors and contributing causes to homosexuality, is the pathogen hypothesis really any more unlikely than the other proposed explanations, especially when they all fail to explain why homosexuality is so unexpectedly common in the first place?

<h2 id="final-thoughts"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Final Thoughts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-final-thoughts">
<p>
For the record, I personally doubt that the pathogen hypothesis would explain a majority of homosexual men, let alone bisexuals and homosexual women.
For other conditions and diseases that have unexplained causes (e.g. left-handedness, schizophrenia, narcolepsy, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, etc), the scientific consensus is that they have multiple causes and/or are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, which is probably true in most cases.
That said, I think that&rsquo;s probably also the case for non-hetero sexual orientations, except that homosexuality (and bisexuality) is probably much more environmental since it&rsquo;s simultaneously maladaptive and unexpectedly prevalent in spite of that.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of this essay was only to make arguments for the pathogen hypothesis, in the interest of encouraging further research into it.
If solid evidence proves that other causes of homosexuality are more likely, then we will rule out the pathogen hypothesis to the extent that it can be disproven.
The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240525183107/https://georgefrancis.substack.com/p/genetics-versus-gay-germ-theory">antagonistic pleiotropy</a>, prenatal immune response, prenatal hormone hypotheses, or some combination of them are probably the next most likely causes, and all of them should be investigated.
</p>

<p>
Most people presume that what we view as good or acceptable must be natural and normal.
This general moralistic fallacy is the main reason why homosexuality is not considered a disorder in recent times.
&ldquo;Disorder&rdquo; is a kind of <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/05/what-is-value.html">value judgment</a>, but with respect to an objective norm, such as biological function.
The cultural view of homosexuality went from judging it as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality_in_the_DSM">&ldquo;morally wrong&rdquo; disorder in the DSM</a> to &ldquo;morally acceptable psychological disorder&rdquo; to &ldquo;natural, normal, and healthy&rdquo;, and even to some extent &ldquo;morally and personally good&rdquo;.
Nowadays, there is huge pushback to anyone pointing out the obvious fact that homosexuality is a biological disorder of some kind, because it&rsquo;s perceived as saying &ldquo;homosexuality is bad&rdquo; (e.g. <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/06/04/letter-amazon-alliance-defending-freedom-cited-white-nationalist-writer-who-once-promoted">here&rsquo;s the SPLC squawking about it</a>).
If the pathogen hypothesis can be verified to be a true cause of male homosexuality, it would be a humiliating and terrifying blow to the LGBTQ+ movement that so much of its cultural activism and virtue-signaling was motivated by pathogens.
But if we are interested in the truth, then we can&rsquo;t discount ideas just because they make us feel uncomfortable.
