<h1 class="title">If Ideologies Had Honest Mottos</h1>
<p class="subtitle" role="doc-subtitle">A One Sentence Summary For Every Ideology</p>
</header><hr>

<p>
Democratic Party: We don&rsquo;t understand economics. Also, everything is racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, and islamaphobic.
</p>

<p>
Republican Party: We support small government and states&rsquo; rights except for when we don&rsquo;t. We are your typical, lazy government bureaucrats.
</p>

<p>
Biden Supporters: That didn&rsquo;t happen. And if it did, it wasn&rsquo;t that bad. And if it was, that&rsquo;s not a big deal. And if it is, that&rsquo;s not our fault. And if it was, we didn&rsquo;t mean it. And if we did, you deserved it.
</p>

<p>
Trump Supporters: Trump&rsquo;s presidency didn&rsquo;t make any significant changes, but he&rsquo;s still anti-establishment. Also don&rsquo;t forget to vote straight ticket Republican.
</p>

<p>
Libertarian Party: What&rsquo;s Aleppo? We are a joke and we don&rsquo;t have our shit together.
</p>

<p>
Green Party: <a href="../civilization/climate-change">Climate change</a> is a serious problem. <a href="https://whatisnuclear.com/one-hundred-percent-renewables.html">Nuclear energy would alleviate it by lowering carbon emissions</a>, but we&rsquo;re still against it anyway.
</p>

<p>
Constitution Party: Extra-religious conservatives who oppose foreign interventionism.
</p>

<p>
Neoliberalism: Leftists that have greater support for the free market.
</p>

<p>
Fascism / Nazism: We are authoritarian nationalists who <a href="../FAQs/eugenics-FAQs#nazis-were-dysgenicists">pretend to understand race and eugenics</a>. We also support autarky and central-planning because we don&rsquo;t understand economics either.
</p>

<p>
Socialism: Rich people are selfish but politicians aren&rsquo;t. We deliberately ignore that <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/04/altruism-and-selfishness.html">all life evolved to be selfish</a>. Also, if this doesn&rsquo;t work out, it wasn&rsquo;t real socialism.
</p>

<p>
Communism: Whatever we say the rich people do, that&rsquo;s what we will do when we&rsquo;re in power, and then some.
</p>

<p>
Monarchism: Kings were born with the right to rule because we said so, and our might makes us right.
</p>


<p>
Anarchism: Government is immoral and unnecessary, never mind why we created it in the first place, or <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/10/the-case-against-anarchism.html">how it&rsquo;s necessary for the progression of human civilization</a>.
</p>

<p>
Libertarianism: We think people should &ldquo;live and let live&rdquo;. And if we ever accomplish our pipe dream ideology, we&rsquo;re going to find out <a href="../civilization/case-against-libertarianism">why it doesn&rsquo;t work at all</a>.
</p>

<p>
Anarcho-Capitalism / Voluntaryism: We think government is bad, even though <a href="../civilization/political-philosophy#goals-of-government">it&rsquo;s necessary to solve game theoretic problems</a>. If we seize power, modern civilization will fight with itself constantly and fall apart.
</p>

<p>
Anarcho-Mutualism: We believe in the free market, but we don&rsquo;t understand that <a href="../civilization/case-against-libertarianism">government is necessary in order to establish and protect the free market</a>. We also don&rsquo;t understand why <a href="../civilization/georgism-crash-course">Georgism</a> is a better solution to land distribution.
</p>

<p>
Anarcho-Communism: Communism and Anarchy are incompatible, so we are essentially the same thing as Communism. Ancaps look like geniuses compared to us.
</p>

<p>
Anarcho-Primitivism: The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. <a href="../civilization/technology">Modern technological society has arguably left humanity worse off</a> due to evolutionary mismatch.
</p>

<p>
Trans-Humanism: We take civilization for granted, and we love to propose unrealistic solutions to humanity&rsquo;s problems because we spend more time reading science fiction than we do <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPXKWDVC">actual, realistic thinking</a>.
</p>

<p>
Islamism: Convert to Islam or die.
</p>


<p>
Georgism: We understand economics better than everyone else, and there isn&rsquo;t a single problem that we&rsquo;re facing that wouldn&rsquo;t be at least partially alleviated by <a href="../civilization/georgism-crash-course">our proposals</a>.
</p>

<p>
Eugenicists: We support one of the <a href="../FAQs/eugenics-FAQs">better ideas of the 20th century</a>, and we lost all our support when people started wrongly associating us with racism and Nazis, an appeal to origin fallacy.
</p>

<p>
Pragmatopians: We want to solve the problems of modernity.
