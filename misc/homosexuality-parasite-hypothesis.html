<h2 id="intro"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
Many authors have previously suggested that pathogens or parasites may be a possible cause of homosexuality, including <a href="https://jaymans.wordpress.com/2014/02/26/greg-cochrans-gay-germ-hypothesis-an-exercise-in-the-power-of-germs/">Gregory Cochran</a> in 2000<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>,
Steve Sailer in 2003<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>,
Peter Frost in 2009<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>,
and likely many others that I am unaware of.
Additionally, the pseudonymous youtube essayist &ldquo;Blithering Genius&rdquo; has elaborated on the hypothesis perhaps most eloquently in his 2016 video, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGv-yNDdjZY">Sacculina</a>&rdquo;.
This theory became viral on September 20, 2021, when an anonymous user on 4chan&rsquo;s <i>pol</i> posted a hypothesis<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>, which became informally known as the &ldquo;worm pill&rdquo;.
This essay is a comprehensive, yet succinct look at the parasite hypothesis for male homosexuality, with regard to the implications it has for specifically.
As of now, I am reserving judgment on other speculative effects of parasite infection, those being motivation to engage in other forms of abnormal sexual behavior: transsexualism, bestiality, etc.
</p>

<p>
Note that female homosexuality likely has different causes from male homosexuality.
The evidence for the parasite hypothesis doesn&rsquo;t fit as well for female homosexuality, we know that there are <a href="#other-causes">some causes of male homosexuality that don&rsquo;t apply to female homosexuals</a>, and female same-sex-attraction is more continuously distributed along the Kinsey scale compared to male same-sex-attraction.
<a href="https://jaymans.wordpress.com/2012/10/28/the-evolution-of-female-bisexuality/">Some biologists have speculated that female homosexuality is a by-product of genetic selection</a>.
In any case, female homosexuality is not the focus of this essay.

<h2 id="parasite-hypothesis-evidence"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Evidence In Favor Of The Parasite Hypothesis</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-parasite-hypothesis-evidence">
<p>
There are examples of similar phenomena that occur in the wild.
A parasite called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacculina">Sacculina</a> infects a male crab by attaching to its genitals and giving it hormones to make it behave like a female crab.
It then causes the male crab to nurse the Sacculina&rsquo;s eggs.
The parasite reproduces and the cycle continues.
A more commonly known example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii">Toxoplasma Gondii</a>.
These parasites reproduce in the intestines of cats and lay eggs in the cat&rsquo;s feces.
They then spread to other intermediary hosts such as rodents.
The parasite infects and modifies the behavior of rodents to make them attracted to cats, rather than fearful of them.
The cat then eats the infected rodent, and Toxoplasma Gondii is able to reproduce again.
These are well established examples of parasites exploiting another organism&rsquo;s form for their own benefit.
</p>

<p>
Since homosexuals don&rsquo;t reproduce, the condition is unlikely to be hereditary.
If it were, then it would select against itself and be an evolutionary dead end.
Instead, the condition is present in more than 1% of the male human population.
This implies that most cases of homosexuality are caused by environmental factors, not genes.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, most people are disgusted by homosexual intercourse and sexual promiscuity.
This instinct (commonly labeled &ldquo;homophobia&rdquo;) is part of the immune system, and is usually reserved towards disease and infection vectors that humans have been exposed to for millennia, such as decaying organisms, insects, arachnids, fecal matter, etc.
This natural instinct is so strong that cultures and religions have evolved explicit values and policies against homosexuality (e.g. Islam and Christianity).
Similar religious policies include the banning of certain kinds of food, or unsafe preparation methods to limit the spread of disease.
In homosexuals, the disgust response towards homosexual intercourse is gone, despite the high risk of catching a multitude of diseases that reside in fecal matter and may be transmitted via anal sex.
Additionally, homosexual men tend to be more sexually promiscuous relative to normal people.
They tend to have sex more often and with far more partners.
These facts are consistent with the parasite hypothesis because an intestinal parasite would be able to spread itself to more hosts if its current hosts engage in frequent anal sex.
These behavior patterns are also consistent with the disgust response in homosexuals being suppressed by something.
</p>

<p>
Pedophilia is another behavior that is more common among the homosexual population than the heterosexual population.
&ldquo;A study in the Journal of Sex Research found that although heterosexuals outnumber homosexuals by a ratio of at least 20 to 1, homosexual pedophiles commit about one-third of the total number of child sex offenses&rdquo; (Dailey)<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup>.
This disparity fits the hypothesis, because it would be advantageous for parasites to infect their hosts as early as possible if they rely on psychologically modifying their hosts.
The younger the host, the more plastic the brain will be.
Parasites are thus motivated to cause their hosts to engage in sexual intercourse with young children and younger men.
</p>

<h3 id="objections-to-parasite-hypothesis"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Addressing Objections to the Parasite Hypothesis</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-objections-to-parasite-hypothesis">
<blockquote>
<p>
But if the parasite transmits itself through anal intercourse, then why would it limit its host population to men? Women can receive anal intercourse too.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Women may be another vector of transmission, but male on male sex is still a more efficient channel of transmission overall, compared to transmitting male to female or female to female.
Males tend to higher sex drives and they have phalluses that make it easier for newly infected hosts to spread the parasite to other hosts via anal intercourse.
Males thus require less modification than females for becoming viable hosts to parasites.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Homosexuals who are attracted to minors are typically interested in teenagers, not prepubescent children.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This does not refute the parasite hypothesis because the adolescent brain is still developing and is more pliable than an adult one.
Adolescent brains are also within the typical age range for when humans start to develop sexual attraction, so teenagers may have the most optimal brains for parasitic modification and re-wiring among all other potential hosts.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Are there ways for the parasite(s) to spread, besides anal intercourse?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It&rsquo;s likely that the parasite can be transmitted in other ways besides anal sex, but more research would be needed to determine what other infection vectors may be viable.

<div id="outline-container-other-causes" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="other-causes"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Other Causes of Male Homosexuality</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-other-causes">
<p>
There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_and_sexual_orientation">other well-documented and proposed causes of homosexuality</a>.
Homosexuality is known to be associated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prenatal_hormones_and_sexual_orientation">abnormal prenatal hormone levels</a> during crucial neurological development periods (Sheppard)<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup> and (Wilson)<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
Another cause is having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternal_birth_order_and_male_sexual_orientation">multiple older brothers</a>, which can cause an immune response or an allergic reaction in the womb that turns male fetuses homosexual.
The mechanism is thought to be a maternal immune response to male fetuses, whereby antibodies neutralize male Y-proteins thought to play a role in sexual differentiation during development.<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8" role="doc-backlink">8</a></sup>
Fraternal birth order is thought to cause homosexuality in at least one-sixth of all homosexual men.
</p>

<p>
Since we know that there are multiple causes of male homosexuality, homosexuals could be separated into two groups if the hypothesis is true: 1. those who have been infected with parasites, and 2. those who have not.
If a large fraction of homosexuals are not affected by the parasite, then future research could investigate the ratio of parasite-infected homosexuals who did pedophilia vs non-parasite-infected homosexuals who did pedophilia, and that could reveal more information about the strong correlation between homosexuality and pedophilia.

<h2 id="final-thoughts"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Final Thoughts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-final-thoughts">
<p>
It&rsquo;s possible that drugs that purge intestinal parasites such as ivermectin (&ldquo;horse de-wormer&rdquo;) could be used to remove such parasites and give infected people another choice about how they continue to live their lives, should this hypothesis be true.
There is anecdotal evidence that this has worked<sup><a id="fnr.4.100" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup>.
We recognize that this is a very speculative and controversial hypothesis, but nonetheless, we recommend that the scientific community conduct more research to investigate the effects of parasite cleansers on homosexuality.<sup><a id="fnr.9.100" class="footref" href="#fn.9" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup>
