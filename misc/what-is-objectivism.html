<h2 id="summary-of-objectivism"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Summary Of Objectivism</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-summary-of-objectivism">
<p>
Objectivism is the Philosophy of Ayn Rand. The lines below give a summary of the philosophy&rsquo;s beliefs.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I exist, I am aware, A is A. Nothing can violate these axioms and everything must obey the laws of reality.</li>
<li>Reality is objective. Contradictions do not exist in reality. The supernatural must be rejected.</li>
<li>The senses are the only means of perceiving reality and they are always valid (when coupled with reason).</li>
<li>People have volition and they should be held accountable for their actions.</li>
<li>Every second the brain runs thousands of calculations. Some of these calculations can be used to form concepts.</li>
<li>Concepts are the abstract mental integration of properties, united by a specific definition.</li>
<li>Sound reasoning is the only valid way to form objective knowledge about reality. Reason is grounded to reality and it is the only valid source of knowledge.</li>
<li>Reason is a three step process consisting of sense perception, concept formation, and logic. Although humans can reason, proper reasoning must be learned by studying epistemology.</li>
<li>Intuition is subconscious reasoning derived from the brain&rsquo;s subliminal calculations. Since intuition is subconscious, humans must use conscious reasoning to make the implicit explicit.</li>
<li>Emotions give life meaning, but they are not a valid source of knowledge. Without emotion, intelligent life is meaningless.</li>
<li>Reason and emotion should exist in harmony to validate each other, but humans should always follow reason before emotion because reason is the only rational way to guide one&rsquo;s life.</li>
<li>All knowledge is based on the information that an individual has acquired about reality through sense-perception and reason. All knowledge is contextual within the context of reality.</li>
<li>Implicitly stated in every scientific claim and discovery are the words: &ldquo;According to all available evidence and knowledge, this is the correct conclusion&rdquo;.</li>
<li>There are four levels of certainty. Propositions can be impossible, possible, probable, and certain. Every individual is born tabula rasa.</li>
<li>Evidence is necessary to deem an idea as &rsquo;possible&rsquo;. If there&rsquo;s no evidence, then it&rsquo;s not possible.</li>
<li>Claims and arbitrary ideas that do not have evidence (such as an all-powerful, all-knowing deity) are impossible.</li>
<li>Reason is the individual&rsquo;s primary tool of survival. The capacity to reason is what makes humans human.</li>
<li>All life is goal-oriented. The most objective values in life are derived from our need to live and survive.</li>
<li>Every value must be a desirable goal that an organism strives to achieve. The alternative to not achieving any value is an undesirable outcome.</li>
<li>Virtues are actions that obtain and maintain our values.</li>
<li>That which furthers life is objectively good. That which harms life is objectively evil.</li>
<li>That which furthers life is rational. That which harms life is irrational. Rationality is good. Irrationality is evil.</li>
<li>It is necessary to see the world as black and white in order to have good ethics. Most people would never do something that is completely evil, so evil must begin in the gray areas.</li>
<li>Therefore, we should only stay in the white areas and refuse to compromise into the gray areas.</li>
<li>The ends can never justify the means. It is evil to show mercy for evil.</li>
<li>Independence mandates that one must be able to think for oneself. Integrity mandates that one must hold true to their ideals.</li>
<li>Actions are only virtuous if they further the individual&rsquo;s life, but a rational being does not desire harming, manipulating, or exploiting others.</li>
<li>Everyone must be judged by their actions so that we determine who is good and who is evil.</li>
<li>Work is required in order to live. Pride is moral ambitiousness and the crowning reward of following good virtues.</li>
<li>Capitalism is the only economic system that maximizes wealth and respects self-ownership and non-aggression.</li>
<li>All rights are ultimately derived from the Non-Aggression Principle. Positive rights don&rsquo;t exist because they require the fruits of someone else&rsquo;s labor.</li>
<li>The only purpose of government should be to ensure that ethics, consequences, and the use of force are used correctly and objectively.</li>
<li>Art is a selective re-creation of reality according to an artist&rsquo;s metaphysical value-judgments.</li>
<li>The goal of philosophy should be to discern objective reality and figure out how to live life on Earth.</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-intro" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="intro"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Introduction To This Critique</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
Most criticisms against Objectivism focus on Rand&rsquo;s support for selfishness, her condemnation of altruism, and her support for Capitalism and Libertarianism.
They are naive and misguided about human nature, but this essay is not your typical critique of Objectivism.
</p>

<p>
For the record, I used to identify as an Objectivist myself, until I started thinking for myself and realizing that most of the Objectivism&rsquo;s core tenants are fallacious.
I talk about <a href="../misc/philosophical-journey">my philosophical journey in more detail here</a>.
The few things that Ayn Rand and I would still agree on are:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There is no such thing as supernatural phenomena (including a supernatural God).</li>
<li>The integration of Empiricism and Rationalism.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Side Note: Kant was actually the first major philosopher to explicitly do this, so that makes Ayn Rand&rsquo;s claim that Kant didn&rsquo;t contribute anything to modern philosophy even weirder.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The standards for certainty. Arbitrary notions should be rejected.</li>
<li>Rational egoism is the best way to live (according to my theory of value).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>However, we justify this differently. Mine is more sound since it uses biological and evolutionary reasoning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Free markets and negative rights are good grounds for running a society.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Although she doesn&rsquo;t truly support negative rights to land, nor does she propose a method that is sufficient for preventing land monopolies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Her proposed ethical virtues of: independence, integrity, honesty, justice, productiveness, egoism (or selfishness as she calls it), and pride are good virtues, aside from the fact that <a href="#objectivism-virtues-vices">all their descriptions are all corrupted by her flaky theory of value and moral assumptions</a>.</li>
<li>Most of her aesthetics philosophy. Imagination is generated from prior sensory data.</li>
<li>She may have realized it, but Objectivism has considerable influence as an ideology because it has good memetic properties, especially with how it markets itself as a &ldquo;philosophy for life on Earth&rdquo;. I support using memetics for spreading rationality, and the <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/04/toward-rational-humanism.html">Rational Humanism value system</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Aside from those things, this essay will refute all the other claims, principles, and conclusions of Objectivism with comprehensive arguments and links to other essays that go into more detail.
</p>

<p>
For the record, I initially learned Objectivism by reading
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220218185331/http://www.groundedlibertarian.com/">GroundedLibertarian.com</a>, which was also the first major philosophical text that I ever read.
Although I have not read Rand&rsquo;s work directly, I don&rsquo;t need to read her original works to know that they&rsquo;re almost entirely wrong and do not conform with reality.
Objectivism doesn&rsquo;t use <a href="../#bio-realism">evolutionary biology</a>, and that alone is sufficient for proving that it doesn&rsquo;t accurately represent reality.
</p>

<p>
If anybody thinks that I am misrepresenting Objectivism, please message me using <a href="../misc/contact">my contact page</a>.
My goal is to present Rand&rsquo;s philosophy correctly, not to misrepresent it.
I&rsquo;m only interested in what&rsquo;s true. I accept what&rsquo;s true, and I reject what&rsquo;s false.
</p>


<p>
To be fair, it&rsquo;s easy to believe that Objectivism is a good philosophy when someone doesn&rsquo;t know much about philosophy to begin with, and I know what that&rsquo;s like because Objectivism was the very first philosophy that I had ever read about it in great depth. The less someone knows about the world, the more amazed they will be upon discovering ideas that are unfamiliar to them.
</p>

<p>
We have to recall that Ayn Rand only had a high school education and three years of post-secondary education at Leningrad State University (where most of coursework was in history), so she didn&rsquo;t have a very good understanding of physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, etc, because she was never educated extensively in those subjects to begin with. The development of Objectivism has thus suffered from Ayn Rand&rsquo;s lack of further formal education beyond what she received.
</p>

<p>
Now we shall begin the critique.

<div id="outline-container-bad-axioms" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="bad-axioms"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> Ayn Rand&rsquo;s Axioms Are Poorly Thought Out</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-bad-axioms">
<p>
To quote from the <a href="http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/axioms">Ayn Rand Lexicon page on Axioms</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
An axiom is a proposition that defeats its opponents by the fact that they have to accept it and use it in the process of any attempt to deny it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Basically, Ayn Rand considers &ldquo;axioms&rdquo; to be the same thing as propositions that can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performative_contradiction">proven by performative contradictions</a>. The fact that she didn&rsquo;t use the term &ldquo;performative contradiction&rdquo; is indicative of her philosophical illiteracy.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, this isn&rsquo;t even the standard definition of &ldquo;axiom&rdquo; that most people use. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom">Wikipedia</a> and most dictionaries define &ldquo;axiom&rdquo; as:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Axioms must also be as parsimonious as possible. The goal is to derive as much knowledge as possible from as few propositions as possible. Knowledge is information compression.
</p>

<p>
If Rand was trying to choose a set of performative contradictions for establishing the axioms of her philosophy, then she did a poor job at that for several reasons:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>For starters, the <a href="../epistemology/performative-contradictions">Axioms of Classical Logic</a> are a far superior set of axioms for philosophy. And they actually count as real axioms, by the standard definition.</li>
<li>She forgot two of the axioms of classical logic, and she didn&rsquo;t state the Identity Axiom (&ldquo;A is A&rdquo;) first, which is the only legitimate axiom in her system.</li>
<li><p>
She claims that the Law of Non-Contradiction (LNC) is a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corollary#Noun">corollary</a> of the Identity Axiom. It would be more appropriate to establish the LNC as a separate axiom. In order to conclude the LNC from the Identity Axiom, you would have to assume (or implicitly assume) what you&rsquo;re trying to prove.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The proof &ldquo;A = A, thus A ≠ ¬A&rdquo; does not conclude &ldquo;A ≠ ¬A&rdquo; unless you implicitly assume &ldquo;A ≠ ¬A&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s not enough information to conclude that &ldquo;A ≠ ¬A&rdquo; can follow from <i>only</i> &ldquo;A = A&rdquo; because there isn&rsquo;t enough information (or axioms).</li>
<li>In Rand&rsquo;s case, she implicitly assumed &ldquo;A ≠ ¬A&rdquo;, but she probably didn&rsquo;t realized that she implicitly assume &ldquo;A ≠ ¬A&rdquo; since it&rsquo;s so axiomatic that people tend to take it for granted.</li>
<li>Hence, the LNC (&ldquo;A ≠ ¬A&rdquo;) is an axiom, not a corollary.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Not only that, but the Law of the Excluded Middle has not been established yet, so the metaphysical concept of &ldquo;¬A&rdquo; and the propositional concept of &ldquo;false&rdquo; have not been established yet.
</p></li>
<li>The first two axioms are actually supposed to be corollaries instead, since they are proven using performative contradiction proofs.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A true axiom is supposed to be a proposition that cannot be proven, but is presupposed to form knowledge. As such, it&rsquo;s not possible to prove an axiom by proof by contradiction.</li>

<li>Her Axioms only work in Metaphysics. By contrast, the <a href="../epistemology/performative-contradictions#classical-axioms-intro">axioms of classical logic</a> have both metaphysical and propositional versions of themselves.</li>
<li>Her insistence that her first two axioms are valid requires using proof by contradiction, in which case, one would assume the opposite of those two &ldquo;axioms&rdquo;, and showing self-refutation.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This doesn&rsquo;t work without first establishing the Law of Identity, the Law of the Excluded Middle, and the Law of Non-Contradiction beforehand, in that order.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="../epistemology/performative-contradictions#axioms-and-basic-theorems">There are many other performative contradictions that can be made</a> besides the ones that she identified.</li>
<li>Her explanations about what an &ldquo;axiom&rdquo; also contributed to making this all more confusing. In one instance, she claimed that an axiom is something that can&rsquo;t be proven because it&rsquo;s self-evident. And in another instance, she claimed that the axioms can be proven when denying them creates a contradiction (proof by contradiction). Either axioms <i>can</i> be proven, or they <i>cannot</i> be proven.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not clear why &ldquo;self-evidence&rdquo; should be considered a valid concept if &ldquo;self-evident&rdquo; propositions can still be questioned.</li>
<li>When Ayn Rand argues that it is necessary to deny materialism, accept the validity of the senses, accept the existence of free will, and deny the arbitrary in order to do anything within the next fields of philosophy (epistemology, ethics, and so forth), she is adhering to coherentism rather than foundationalism, even though her philosophy accepts three basic beliefs (albeit poorly chosen ones).</li>
</ol>
<p>
Moreover, <a href="../epistemology/tabula-rasa-and-ECG">the human mind does not affirm these axioms when it begins to understand the world around it</a>.
Aristotle&rsquo;s axioms are only useful when a human mind sufficiently processes the world around itself, and starts over with just the axioms and builds upon that step by step.

<p>
All Objectivists have subconsciously adopted the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_theory_of_truth">Correspondence Theory of Truth</a>, but they never bothered to question whether it&rsquo;s actually right or not.
If people had direct knowledge of reality, then it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible for them to be wrong about anything.
People learn by experience (i.e. indirectly).
At most, people can build a mental model of what they <i>think</i> reality is, but they can never build a <i>perfect</i> knowledge of reality because omniscience is impossible.
If the model is wrong, then they have to readjust their knowledge to form a more accurate model of reality.
</p>

<p>
Objectivism does acknowledge that it&rsquo;s possible for ideas to be wrong, and that wrong ideas should be changed if they don&rsquo;t match reality, but if that&rsquo;s the case, then that implies that knowledge and truth about reality are formed according to a <i>mental model</i>, i.e. sensory input and reason do not provide direct knowledge of reality.
</p>

<p>
Objective truth doesn&rsquo;t exist for similar reasons.
Conscious minds can only have <a href="#subject-object-dichotomy">subjective</a>, perspective-dependent models of that <a href="#subject-object-dichotomy">objective reality</a>.
No proposition can ever be truly be labeled as &ldquo;objectively true&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s always possible to be wrong about that said propositions if further knowledge of reality invalidates that proposition&rsquo;s truth value assignment.
Truth is essentially the same thing as knowledge, because whatever people &ldquo;know&rdquo; is whatever they will assert to be &ldquo;true&rdquo;.

Ayn Rand argued that Free Will exists, but the way she defines &ldquo;free will&rdquo; and &ldquo;determinism&rdquo; is vague and naive, and the ultimate conclusion she reaches about it is not well-supported by modern physics.

Rationalizing in ethics and axiology is natural, not anti-virtuous. Rand condemns this rationalizing as &ldquo;irrational&rdquo;, even though it&rsquo;s both natural and a consequence of evolution.

A lot of Objectivists find Objectivism appealing because it fits their moral intuitions and justifies them, <a href="../epistemology/difficult-to-change-minds#hub-and-spoke-networks">within their belief networks</a>.
Objectivism preaches that people should never murder, never steal, and never harm others, and it also proclaims that the good and evil dichotomy is symmetrical to rationality versus irrationality.
But this is not the case. Objectivism ignores that <a href="../FAQs/post-overton-FAQs#when-life-becomes-zero-sum">value judgments are both positive <i>and</i> negative</a>, especially when a population of organisms reaches the carrying capacity of its environment.

A successful society can (and must) outlaw murder, theft, and violence within the society, but <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/07/circles-of-control-and-freedom.html">it only does so by redirecting the violence outwards towards other societies and outsiders</a>.
Additionally, just because societies outlaw murder, theft, and other crimes against other members of society, that doesn&rsquo;t conclude that it can&rsquo;t still be within one&rsquo;s self-interest to commit crimes against others, especially if the individual knows that he can get away with it.

<h3 id="emotions"><span class="section-number-3">4.3.</span> The True Nature Of Emotions And <i>Why</i> They Exist</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-emotions">
<p>
Emotions exist to make people better at reproducing and raising offspring. Emotions are needed to generate actions in the real world. Note that I am <i>not</i> saying here that we should put emotions before reasoning, or anything like that. I&rsquo;m only explaining why animals evolved to have emotions, and the function of emotions, which Ayn Rand failed to do.
</p>

<p>
For example, romantic love does not exist merely to make you feel good or to be an expression of your feeling. Love exists because it made our ancestors more efficient at procreating and raising children who would live to adulthood to have children of their own. In the past, male and female organisms who didn&rsquo;t have love or strong emotional bonds towards each other were less likely to stay together to raise their offspring, which endangered their offspring&rsquo;s probability of survival. On the other hand, animals who did evolve to a capacity to romantically love one another were more likely to stick together to protect their children from accidents and predators, thus increasing their reproductive success.
</p>

<p>
More generally, pain and pleasure are biological motivators that were evolutionarily developed to trigger and provide impetus for sentient organisms to do things that sustain their lives and reproduction.

</p>

<p>
Another thing that Rand has overlooked is that reason isn&rsquo;t necessarily the <i>only</i> valid source of knowledge since emotions are a source of value knowledge when it comes to ethics. Natural instincts such as a fear of spiders and falling from high heights should also be considered knowledge. They indicate that such things threaten our odds of survival.

<p>
<b>Wrong.</b> The consequences of overpopulation are: global civilizational collapse, <i>billions</i> of people dying, and a permanent dark age. So yes, if you think those things are undesirable (as most people do), then there <i>is</i> a reasonable and &ldquo;moral&rdquo; basis for regulating how many children people can have.
</p>

<p>
If we don&rsquo;t regulate reproduction, then we are destined to face the largest, most catastrophic overpopulation event in history, followed by the largest <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html">famines and wars ever seen before in human history</a>.

<h3 id="immortal-robot-wrong-conclusions"><span class="section-number-3">4.6.</span> The Immortal Robot Thought Experiment Arrives At The Wrong Conclusions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-immortal-robot-wrong-conclusions">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
A simpler thought experiment that arrives at the same conclusions and provides better insight would be to imagine a universe that has no sentient life at all. This thought experiment takes less explaining to get the point across, and it is more readily apparent that all value ultimately originates from sentient life, hence a universe with no sentient life is a universe with no value at all.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If there is no sentient life in the universe, then there is no Value either. It follows that all Value ultimately originates from sentient beings and their perspectives on reality. Since Value is necessarily perspective-dependent from the viewpoint of sentient being(s), it is thus impossible for Value to be objective by the definition of &ldquo;Objective&rdquo;.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>This proves that all value is subjective, since value originates from sentient organisms, and different organisms have different values. &ldquo;Objective Value&rdquo; is an oxymoron.</li>
<li>Morality is based on value, <a href="https://stateofthenihil.wordpress.com/2019/09/22/reason-is-not-the-basis-for-morality/">not reason</a>. If objective value doesn&rsquo;t exist, then it is necessarily the case that objective morality cannot exist either. Morality is therefore subjective since it is based on Value, which is based on the perspectives(s) of sentient life.</li>
<li>It is true that most humans intuitively derive their purpose and meaning from doing things that sustain their lives (<a href="../misc/industrial-society-and-its-future-manifesto#power-process">the power process</a>), but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make it the chosen life purpose for all humans.</li>
</ol>
<p>
There is no uniquely rational way to define value philosophically.
To illustrate this, if we were to ask: &ldquo;What is the best theory of value?&rdquo;, then we would need a theory of value in order to answer the question because it&rsquo;s a normative question.
But we can&rsquo;t use a theory of value to answer the question if we haven&rsquo;t already established the right theory value that we should use.
This infinite regress demonstrates that there is no foundation for value in philosophy.
</p>

<p>
Since we cannot judge values unless we have already chosen a value framework beforehand, it is inaccurate to claim that <i>all</i> values can/should be derived from valuing life, reason, purpose, and self-esteem.
It would be more accurate to claim that we have higher levels values that all affirm each other, which collectively lower levels of values, and so on.
</p>

<p>
At most, we can define a theory of value and use it to justify itself, hence why <a href="../epistemology/axiology#reproduction-objective-purpose">life and reproduction are intuitively good values</a>.
But that still doesn&rsquo;t conclude that life is the objective value.
As a counter-example, Efilists could value exterminating all the life on Planet Earth, and <a href="../misc/case-against-efilism#argument-for-efilism">they could justify it with reasons that many people would find appealing</a>.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, unlike truth, value is not convergent for similar brains because <a href="../FAQs/post-overton-FAQs#when-life-becomes-zero-sum">it&rsquo;s possible for people to have conflicting positive and negative value judgments</a>, especially in an environment with scarce resources.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Tom and Joe could have identical brains, but make very different value judgments from their perspectives.
For example, suppose that Joe and Tom both want to date Sally.
Their value judgments are identical in one way, but opposite in another way.
Joe positively values Joe dating Sally, and negatively values Tom dating Sally.
Tom positively values Tom dating Sally, and negatively values Joe dating Sally.

Since the conclusions made by the Immortal Robot are less useful and more complicated, it doesn&rsquo;t contribute anything new to Philosophy.

Reason is not synonymous with morality, nor can reason alone serve as a basis for morality because the true basis for morality is value, <a href="#immortal-robot-wrong-conclusions">as established in the last section</a>.
Moral relativism is a corollary that follows from this.
The subjectivity of morality debunks the entire foundation of the Objectivist theory of ethics, to the point that everything must be re-thought from the ground up.
Although a lot of the political philosophy ends up the same in the end, and it is important to understand the different reasoning that arrived at these conclusions.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, irrationality is <i>not</i> the origin of all evil.
&ldquo;Evil&rdquo; People aren&rsquo;t evil because they&rsquo;re irrational.
They&rsquo;re &ldquo;evil&rdquo; because either: 1. they need to fight against others for scarce resources to survive, or 2. they have a value system that opposes other perspectives.
Deeming anything &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;evil&rdquo; implies a value judgment of some kind, and we can&rsquo;t make judgments unless we have already adopted an a priori theory of value.
</p>

<p>
If anything, it&rsquo;s irrational to unilaterally declare anything to be &ldquo;evil&rdquo; or to view morality as black and white because that entails having unquestioned implicit assumptions.
Even if morality were objective, there&rsquo;s always more ways to be wrong than there are ways to be right, so anybody who <i>thinks</i> that they are abiding by supposedly objective moral standards is probably wrong.
Many people would also use their belief that they are imposing the one and only true &ldquo;objective&rdquo; morality as a justification to rule with an iron fist.

First, Life doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be a virtue.
Efilism is a counter-example of a worldview where it isn&rsquo;t virtuous to do things that sustain life because it aims to annihilate all life.
Anarcho-Primitivism is another counter-example where technology that would extend life isn&rsquo;t necessarily virtuous since the consequences are perceived to be greater than the benefits.
The goal of Anarcho-Primitivism is to just exist.
Values are arbitrary, so there&rsquo;s no reason why values aligned with Efilism, Anarcho-Primitivism, or some other worldview should be inherently anti-virtuous.

<p>
It is true that people can and should lie to a criminal or an abusive government if it will lessen the harm that the perpetrator does.
And it is also true that lying in most other situations will require that the individual must avoid getting caught and punished.
I agree that lying can cause a person to lose their independence in the sense that they become dependent on other finding out about their lies, but there&rsquo;s no reason why a person shouldn&rsquo;t lie if lying will benefit them <i>and</i> they can get away with it without any negative consequences.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps a liar or a thief would feel guilt and would be unable to go through the power process of obtaining items/money via their own labor, but there&rsquo;s no reason why they should feel that way if they understand that <a href="#immortal-robot-wrong-conclusions">there&rsquo;s no foundation for value or morality</a>.
The benefits of honesty are <i>not</i> enough to compel people towards &ldquo;good&rdquo; behavior in the absence of government and other means of resolving game-theoretical problems.

<a href="../#fake-research">Academia is designed to cultivate just as much intellectual dishonesty as it promotes honest research</a>, but Objectivists don&rsquo;t recognize or address this.

Objectivism emphasizes judging everybody and everything according to reason.
This is a reasonable position that I do not contest.
What I do object to are the values that Objectivism preaches for judging everything.
We&rsquo;ve already covered the <a href="#immortal-robot-wrong-conclusions">problems with Objectivism&rsquo;s theory of value and morality</a>.
</p>

<p>
A minor thing that I will nitpick here is that Objectivism thinks that there&rsquo;s no rational basis for judging people based on race.
<a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#averages-and-exceptions">Every person <i>should</i> initially be given the benefit of the doubt, regardless of what their race is</a>.
<a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#environmental-factors">However, the reality is that some races are genetically predisposed to be more/less violent, more/less intelligent, and more/less cooperative than others</a>.
It <i>is</i> reasonable to take someone&rsquo;s race into account when judging the probability that they will do a given type of action, and it is also reasonable to reassess those probabilities after getting to known an individual better.
</p>

<p>
Objectivists also believe that they shouldn&rsquo;t spend/waste their time doing something if they don&rsquo;t perceive it to benefit them.
I agree with this in principle, but since they have unquestioned assumptions and they are the judge of whether or not someone/something benefits them, they can&rsquo;t accurately judge whether something will benefit them or not.

Rand gives mostly good advice on pride, but it still encounters the same problems as the other virtues, i.e. a <a href="../epistemology/axiology#intro">rational theory of value</a> for establishing the virtue (what we should be proud of) must be determined beforehand.

Work is required by nature, and it&rsquo;s often important to a &ldquo;fulfilling&rdquo; life.

A better and most realistic way to think about life, careers, and relationships is like fishing.
The people who say that &ldquo;people should follow their passions&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;people should do what they love&rdquo; are already passionate about doing what they do, so their advice sets an impossible high bar for everyone else.
Some spots are beautiful to you and will help you catch fish, but other spots won&rsquo;t, but you can&rsquo;t know where you would like to spend time until you go there and you can&rsquo;t know how many fish you will catch there until you try.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-initiating-force-not-a-vice">
<p>
Rand argues that using &ldquo;force&rdquo; is unethical and irrational because it supposedly takes away a person&rsquo;s ability to reason.
There are multiple problems with this:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>&ldquo;Force&rdquo; is arbitrary and poorly defined (a &ldquo;floating abstraction&rdquo; as Rand would call it), especially if <a href="../civilization/case-against-libertarianism#NAP">it&rsquo;s defined according to the Non-Aggression <del>Principle</del> Spectrum</a>.</li>
<li>A person can still reason even if there&rsquo;s force being exerted against them. People do it everyday. People who pay taxes aren&rsquo;t able to reason any better or any worse than people who don&rsquo;t. Defendants must also use reason to argue for their release when they are held in a courtroom.</li>
<li><a href="https://zerocontradictions.github.io../epistemology/free-will#agency-is-circumstantial">Agency is circumstantial</a>. Most people have to deal with decisions that are much more &ldquo;forceful&rdquo; than taxation or complying with legal codes, in the sense that they have the agency to pay taxes, and have comparatively far less agency to make tougher decisions between greater conflicting values.</li>
<li>It does not follow that force is unethical or irrational on the basis that it takes away another person&rsquo;s ability to reason. This argument is rationalizing, not a rational argument. In fact, there are many cases where it&rsquo;s rational to prevent or weaken another person(s)&rsquo;s ability to reason <a href="#life-is-violent">if they have conflicting values</a>.</li>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-force-counter-arguments">
<p>
Now we shall address some Objectivist arguments regarding why they think force is objectively bad.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When people hurt others, it&rsquo;s ultimately bad for their survival and reproduction in an intelligent society.
People hurt others because their lower-level processes and instincts haven&rsquo;t been corrected by reason yet.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You don&rsquo;t eliminate violence with &ldquo;reason&rdquo;.
You eliminate it within a society by using a government that <a href="../civilization/political-philosophy#goals-of-government">solves game-theoretical problems</a>.
And as we&rsquo;ll see in the future, this unusual era of peace that has largely persisted in humanity for the last 80 years will only continue to exist if governments are reformed to also <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/07/natural-resource-taxation.html">manage resource scarcity</a> and <a href="../FAQs/overpopulation-FAQs">population control</a>.
In a resource-scarce environment, people hurt others because they&rsquo;ll starve to death if they don&rsquo;t.
This is why <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html">warfare occurred throughout human history for thousands of years</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/07/circles-of-control-and-freedom.html">A society can eliminate violence within the society</a>, especially if it&rsquo;s intelligent and prosperous, but we still have to recall that the elimination of violence in that society occurs because the society resolved the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma with respect to violence.
People (usually) don&rsquo;t commit violence in such a society because they live under circumstances that discourage violence while making it easy to make a living without resorting to violence.
Since the human propensity for violence is <i>always</i> circumstantial, we cannot assume that that non-violence is a natural consequence of being &ldquo;rational&rdquo;.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Just start robbing your neighbors while trying to live a good life, and tell me when it starts working out for you.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is a false equivocation.
Robbing people in our current world would occur in the context of a society with rules that outlaw violence, a society that solves the <a href="../civilization/political-philosophy#PDs">Societal Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma</a>.
But if a thief can manage to steal things without getting caught, then the thievery works out for the thieves.
They manage to acquire free stuff without having to pay for it.
</p>

<p>
Objectivists tend to counter-argue that the thieves would feel guilt and would be unable to go through the power process of obtaining items/money via their own labor, but there&rsquo;s no reason why they should feel that way if they understand that <a href="#immortal-robot-wrong-conclusions">they have a different conception of morality and/or they recognize that there&rsquo;s no foundation for value or morality</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
All of that is easily taken care of by basic logic.
What happens when you rape and kill people?
What will others do to you out of their fear of you?
Is what they do good or bad for your continued life as a human?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Committing crimes may endanger a person&rsquo;s survival and ability to procreate <i>within a functioning society</i>, but <a href="#immortal-robot-wrong-conclusions">values and morality are still subjective</a>.
There are no objective reasons why a criminal should value his own life and reproductive success over committing crimes.
On the other hand, if raping, killing, and stealing are reproductively successful strategies in an environment, then that&rsquo;s exactly what evolution will select for.
That fact is not changed by reason or &ldquo;basic logic&rdquo;.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Individuals can use their ability to reason to eliminate violence on an individual level.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Not really. <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#race-gap-crime-rates">Different genes</a> and different circumstances affect people&rsquo;s propensities for violence, so violence is often beyond people&rsquo;s control, on an individual level.

No one is claiming that collectives are not composed of individuals.
But you can&rsquo;t think of collective entities as <i>isolated</i> individuals (e.g. the United States government, Ford Motors, the Free Software Foundation, etc).
Collectives exist as a mental concept because it&rsquo;s useful to think of them that way.
We don&rsquo;t achieve anything by denying that we can think of them as concepts.
The United States government, Ford Motors, the Free Software Foundation, etc are not single individuals.
They could never function as the work of only a single person.
Collective entities are defined as individuals who work together in specialized roles within a power structure to create a functional system that dedicates itself towards a goal.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;Collective Values&rdquo; benefit majorities by oppressing minorities. They are a dangerous concept.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The existence of minorities does not cause collective entities to break down as a concept.
As mentioned, all collective entities consist of a <i>power structure</i>, so it is implied that most people in the collective do not have equal power (in most cases) to get <i>exactly</i> what they want (which would be world-domination for most people, because <a href="#life-is-violent">life is selfish</a>).
Minorities can be harmed by collective interests, but that&rsquo;s just part of nature <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html">(1)</a>, <a href="https://expandingrationality.substack.com/p/circles-of-order-and-chaos">(2)</a>, <a href="https://expandingrationality.substack.com/p/the-modern-problems-with-conformity">(3)</a>, <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/07/circles-of-control-and-freedom.html">(4)</a>.
If a collective entity should never override the desires of a minority, then laws against theft, murder, rape, etc shouldn&rsquo;t exist either because they override the desires of criminals.
People can opt out of society any time they&rsquo;d like, but as soon as they do so, they become an outsider.
Freedom exists within a system of constraints, and <a href="https://zerocontradictions.github.io../epistemology/free-will#agency-is-circumstantial">agency is always circumstantial</a>.

<p>
Although Rand was a harsh critic of Anarcho-Capitalism, many of her followers are Anarcho-Capitalists since Objectivist Ethics are a gateway into believing in Anarcho-Capitalism. Anarcho-Capitalists are just as ignorant about human nature as Communists are, and their political ideology is equally dangerous to Modern Civilization. Many of them will be reading this critique, so this has to be addressed.
</p>

<p>
The Anarcho-Objectivists are a case of <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/07/status-pyramid-schemes.html">purity spiraling among the Objectivist community</a>.
For that reason, Objectivism is a net-negative to civilization because Ancaps are more opposed to Georgism than literally every other political ideology out there.
They are thus <a href="../civilization/georgism-crash-course">the greatest opponents to solving the greatest economic problems that are facing the modern world</a>.
So although Objectivism advocates for a pro-free-market philosophy, it ironically (albeit indirectly) promotes an extremely anti-free market philosophy since <a href="../civilization/case-against-libertarianism#free-markets-circular-reasoning">it&rsquo;s not possible to have free markets at all without a government to establish them</a>, nor is it possible to have <a href="#equal-negative-land-rights">free markets without equal negative land rights for everybody</a>.

Setting Anarcho-Objectivism aside, even standard Objectivism still promotes ideas that are harmful to the preservation of modern civilization due to its obsession with individualist libertarian morals. <a href="#race-denialism">Racial denialism</a>, opposition to eugenics, and free-range immigration policies will increase the proliferation of dysgenics in modern society, <a href="../FAQs/overpopulation-FAQs">cornucopian delusions</a> will increase the risk of civilization collapsing due overpopulation in the long run, and an <a href="../civilization/philosophy-of-technology.html #technology">overly optimistic and one-sided view of technology</a> will distract humanity from addressing the problems created by the evolutionary mismatch in our world.

In my experience, Objectivists don&rsquo;t tend to be deep-thinkers or good philosophers.
In most online circles, they tend to parrot quotes and definitions verbatim or fight over typical political questions, without doing any actual thinking.
When other people do rightfully point out the flaws in Objectivism, the Objectivists typically respond by turning the discussion into a debate over why they think their <a href="#sloppy-definitions">poorly thought out definitions</a> are better than the opposition&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t know how to think outside the semantic framework that they learned.
It confuses them when other people can or when other people don&rsquo;t use the same definitions as they do.
It&rsquo;s understandable why some people would think like this if they&rsquo;re young and don&rsquo;t have much exposure to better philosophy, but if someone is truly intelligent and able to question the philosophy&rsquo;s assumptions, then they&rsquo;ll eventually reject it, just as I had done in my early 20s.

<p>
Objectivists usually discover Objectivism by reading Ayn Rand&rsquo;s fiction novels, and people who are introduced to philosophy via that way tend to not be intellectuals to begin with, statistically speaking.
Deeper philosophical thinkers either do their own serious thinking, and/or they read expository works to introduce themselves to other ideas.
There&rsquo;s also a filter effect at play here too.
The smarter Objectivists don&rsquo;t tend to stay Objectivists forever, so they eventually reject the philosophy just like I did, and the pool of actual intellectuals (if any) within the Objectivist Community grows ever smaller.
</p>

<p>
It is a shame that tens of millions of dollars are wasted every year promoting Objectivism by the Ayn Rand Institute and the Atlas Society, when all that money could be spent promoting quality philosophy and creating truly rational thinkers for tackling the greatest problems of the 21st century.

<p>
Nevertheless, <a href="#intro">I do agree with Objectivism on this list of bullet points</a> that I wrote in the introduction. Although I&rsquo;m clearly not a fan of Ayn Rand&rsquo;s philosophy, I would say that she had a better philosophy than most of the humans or philosophers who had ever lived prior to the creation of the Internet.

The noun phrase &ldquo;Free Will&rdquo; tends to be categorized more often as an epistemological concept, whereas determinism is seen more as a metaphysical concept. But &ldquo;metaphysics&rdquo; is a rather misleading concept to begin with since it leads people into believing in Platonism, for which there isn&rsquo;t very strong evidence to support.
