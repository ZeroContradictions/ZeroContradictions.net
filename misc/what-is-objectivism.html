<h2 id="summary-of-objectivism"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Summary Of Objectivism</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-summary-of-objectivism">
<p>
Objectivism is the Philosophy of Ayn Rand. The lines below give a summary of the philosophy&rsquo;s beliefs.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I exist, I am aware, A is A. Nothing can violate these axioms and everything must obey the laws of reality.</li>
<li>Reality is objective. Contradictions do not exist in reality. The supernatural must be rejected.</li>
<li>The senses are the only means of perceiving reality and they are always valid (when coupled with reason).</li>
<li>People have volition and they should be held accountable for their actions.</li>
<li>Every second the brain runs thousands of calculations. Some of these calculations can be used to form concepts.</li>
<li>Concepts are the abstract mental integration of properties, united by a specific definition.</li>
<li>Sound reasoning is the only valid way to form objective knowledge about reality. Reason is grounded to reality and it is the only valid source of knowledge.</li>
<li>Reason is a three step process consisting of sense perception, concept formation, and logic. Although humans can reason, proper reasoning must be learned by studying epistemology.</li>
<li>Intuition is subconscious reasoning derived from the brain&rsquo;s subliminal calculations. Since intuition is subconscious, humans must use conscious reasoning to make the implicit explicit.</li>
<li>Emotions give life meaning, but they are not a valid source of knowledge. Without emotion, intelligent life is meaningless.</li>
<li>Reason and emotion should exist in harmony to validate each other, but humans should always follow reason before emotion because reason is the only rational way to guide one&rsquo;s life.</li>
<li>All knowledge is based on the information that an individual has acquired about reality through sense-perception and reason. All knowledge is contextual within the context of reality.</li>
<li>Implicitly stated in every scientific claim and discovery are the words: &ldquo;According to all available evidence and knowledge, this is the correct conclusion&rdquo;.</li>
<li>There are four levels of certainty. Propositions can be impossible, possible, probable, and certain. Every individual is born tabula rasa.</li>
<li>Evidence is necessary to deem an idea as &rsquo;possible&rsquo;. If there&rsquo;s no evidence, then it&rsquo;s not possible.</li>
<li>Claims and arbitrary ideas that do not have evidence (such as an all-powerful, all-knowing deity) are impossible.</li>
<li>Reason is the individual&rsquo;s primary tool of survival. The capacity to reason is what makes humans human.</li>
<li>All life is goal-oriented. The most objective values in life are derived from our need to live and survive.</li>
<li>Every value must be a desirable goal that an organism strives to achieve. The alternative to not achieving any value is an undesirable outcome.</li>
<li>Virtues are actions that obtain and maintain our values.</li>
<li>That which furthers life is objectively good. That which harms life is objectively evil.</li>
<li>That which furthers life is rational. That which harms life is irrational. Rationality is good. Irrationality is evil.</li>
<li>It is necessary to see the world as black and white in order to have good ethics. Most people would never do something that is completely evil, so evil must begin in the gray areas.</li>
<li>Therefore, we should only stay in the white areas and refuse to compromise into the gray areas.</li>
<li>The ends can never justify the means. It is evil to show mercy for evil.</li>
<li>Independence mandates that one must be able to think for oneself. Integrity mandates that one must hold true to their ideals.</li>
<li>Actions are only virtuous if they further the individual&rsquo;s life, but a rational being does not desire harming, manipulating, or exploiting others.</li>
<li>Everyone must be judged by their actions so that we determine who is good and who is evil.</li>
<li>Work is required in order to live. Pride is moral ambitiousness and the crowning reward of following good virtues.</li>
<li>Capitalism is the only economic system that maximizes wealth and respects self-ownership and non-aggression.</li>
<li>All rights are ultimately derived from the Non-Aggression Principle. Positive rights don&rsquo;t exist because they require the fruits of someone else&rsquo;s labor.</li>
<li>The only purpose of government should be to ensure that ethics, consequences, and the use of force are used correctly and objectively.</li>
<li>Art is a selective re-creation of reality according to an artist&rsquo;s metaphysical value-judgments.</li>
<li>The goal of philosophy should be to discern objective reality and figure out how to live life on Earth.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="intro"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Introduction To This Critique</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
Most criticisms against Objectivism focus on Rand&rsquo;s support for selfishness, her condemnation of altruism, and her support for Capitalism and Libertarianism. They are naive and misguided about human nature, but this essay is not your typical critique of Objectivism.
</p>

<p>
For the record, I used to identify as an Objectivist myself, until I started thinking for myself and realizing that most of the Objectivism&rsquo;s core tenants are fallacious. I talk about <a href="../misc/philosophical-journey">my philosophical journey in more detail here</a>. The few things that Ayn Rand and I would still agree on are:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There is no such thing as supernatural phenomena (including a supernatural God).</li>
<li>The integration of Empiricism and Rationalism.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Side Note: Kant was actually the first major philosopher to explicitly do this, so that makes Ayn Rand&rsquo;s claim that Kant didn&rsquo;t contribute anything to modern philosophy even weirder.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The standards for certainty. Arbitrary notions should be rejected.</li>
<li>Rational egoism is the best way to live (according to my theory of value).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>However, we justify this differently. Mine is more sound since it uses biological and evolutionary reasoning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Free markets and negative rights are good grounds for running a society.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Although she doesn&rsquo;t truly support negative rights to land, nor does she propose a method that is sufficient for preventing land monopolies.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Her proposed ethical virtues of: independence, integrity, honesty, justice, productiveness, egoism (or selfishness as she calls it), and pride are good virtues.</li>
<li>Most of her aesthetics philosophy. Imagination is generated from prior sensory data.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Aside from those things, this essay will refute all the other claims, principles, and conclusions of Objectivism with comprehensive arguments and links to other essays that go into more detail.
</p>


<p>
To be fair, it is easy to believe that Objectivism is a good philosophy when someone doesn&rsquo;t know much about philosophy to begin with, and I know what that&rsquo;s like because Objectivism was the very first philosophy that I had ever read about it in great depth. The less someone knows about the world, the more amazed they will be upon discovering ideas that are unfamiliar to them.
</p>

<p>
We have to recall that Ayn Rand only had a high school education and three years of post-secondary education at Leningrad State University (where most of coursework was in history), so she didn&rsquo;t have a very good understanding of physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, etc, because she was never educated extensively in those subjects to begin with. The development of Objectivism has thus suffered from Ayn Rand&rsquo;s lack of further formal education beyond what she received.
</p>

<p>
Now we shall begin the critique.

<div id="outline-container-bad-axioms" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="bad-axioms"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> Ayn Rand&rsquo;s Axioms Are Poorly Thought Out</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-bad-axioms">
<p>
To quote from the <a href="http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/axioms">Ayn Rand Lexicon page on Axioms</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
An axiom is a proposition that defeats its opponents by the fact that they have to accept it and use it in the process of any attempt to deny it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Basically, Ayn Rand considers &ldquo;axioms&rdquo; to be the same thing as propositions that can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performative_contradiction">proven by performative contradictions</a>. The fact that she didn&rsquo;t use the term &ldquo;performative contradiction&rdquo; is indicative of her philosophical illiteracy.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, this isn&rsquo;t even the standard definition of &ldquo;axiom&rdquo; that most people use. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom">Wikipedia</a> and most dictionaries define &ldquo;axiom&rdquo; as:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Axioms must also be as parsimonious as possible. The goal is to derive as much knowledge as possible from as few propositions as possible. Knowledge is information compression.
</p>

<p>
If Rand was trying to choose a set of performative contradictions for establishing the axioms of her philosophy, then she did a poor job at that for several reasons:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>For starters, the <a href="../epistemology/2A-classical-logic">Axioms of Classical Logic</a> are a far superior axiomatic system for philosophy. And they actually count as real axioms, by the standard definition.</li>
<li>She forgot two of the axioms of classical logic, and she didn&rsquo;t state the Identity Axiom (&ldquo;A is A&rdquo;) first, which is the only legitimate axiom in her system.</li>
<li><p>
She claims that the Law of Non-Contradiction (LNC) is a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corollary#Noun">corollary</a> of the Identity Axiom. It would be more appropriate to establish the LNC as a separate axiom. In order to conclude the LNC from the Identity Axiom, you would have to assume (or implicitly assume) what you&rsquo;re trying to prove.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The proof &ldquo;A = A, thus A ≠ ¬A&rdquo; does not conclude &ldquo;A ≠ ¬A&rdquo; unless you implicitly assume &ldquo;A ≠ ¬A&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s not enough information to conclude that &ldquo;A ≠ ¬A&rdquo; can follow from <i>only</i> &ldquo;A = A&rdquo; because there isn&rsquo;t enough information (or axioms).</li>
<li>In Rand&rsquo;s case, she implicitly assumed &ldquo;A ≠ ¬A&rdquo;, but she probably didn&rsquo;t realized that she implicitly assume &ldquo;A ≠ ¬A&rdquo; since it&rsquo;s so axiomatic that people tend to take it for granted.</li>
<li>Hence, the LNC (&ldquo;A ≠ ¬A&rdquo;) is an axiom, not a corollary.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Not only that, but the Law of the Excluded Middle has not been established yet, so the metaphysical concept of &ldquo;¬A&rdquo; and the propositional concept of &ldquo;false&rdquo; have not been established yet.
</p></li>
<li>The first two axioms are actually supposed to be corollaries instead, since they are proven using performative contradiction proofs.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A true axiom is supposed to be a proposition that cannot be proven, but is presupposed to form knowledge. As such, it&rsquo;s not possible to prove an axiom by proof by contradiction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Her Axioms only work in Metaphysics. By contrast, the <a href="../epistemology/2A-classical-logic">axioms of classical logic</a> have both metaphysical and propositional versions of themselves.</li>
<li>Her insistence that her first two axioms are valid requires using proof by contradiction, in which case, one would assume the opposite of those two &ldquo;axioms&rdquo;, and showing self-refutation.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This doesn&rsquo;t work without first establishing the Law of Identity, the Law of the Excluded Middle, and the Law of Non-Contradiction beforehand, in that order.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="../epistemology/2B-performative-contradictions#axioms-and-basic-theorems">There are many other performative contradictions that could be made</a> besides the ones that she identified.</li>
<li>Her explanations about what an &ldquo;axiom&rdquo; also contributed making this all more confusing. In one instance, she claimed that an axiom is something that can&rsquo;t be proven because it&rsquo;s self-evident. And in another instance, she claimed that the axioms can be proven when denying them creates a contradiction (proof by contradiction). Either axioms <i>can</i> be proven, or they <i>cannot</i> be proven.</li>
<li>When Ayn Rand argues that it is necessary to deny materialism, accept the validity of the senses, accept the existence of free will, and deny the arbitrary in order to do anything within the next fields of philosophy (epistemology, ethics, and so forth), she is adhering to coherentism rather than foundationalism, even though her philosophy accepts three basic beliefs (albeit poorly chosen ones).</li>
</ol>
<p>
Moreover, <a href="../epistemology/1D-tabula-rasa-and-ECG">the human mind does not begin with these axioms when it begins to understand the world around it</a>. Aristotle&rsquo;s axioms are only useful when a human mind sufficiently processes the world around itself, and starts over with just the axioms and builds upon that step by step.

<li>Ayn Rand&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;concept&rdquo; relies on the definition of &ldquo;property&rdquo;, but she never defines what a &ldquo;property&rdquo; is. A more coherent and non-circular definition for concept is: &ldquo;Anything or any idea that the human mind can think about.&rdquo;

At most, people can build a mental model of what they <i>think</i> reality is, but they can never build a <i>perfect</i> knowledge of reality because omniscience is impossible.

Objective truth doesn&rsquo;t exist for similar reasons.

Ayn Rand argued that Free Will exists, but the way she defines &ldquo;free will&rdquo; and &ldquo;determinism&rdquo; is vague and naive, and the ultimate conclusion she reaches about it is not well-supported by modern physics. Before we can even talk about this topic, we have to define some definitions for determinism and free will<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
since these terms are all vulnerable to the <a href="../language/sapir-whorf-theory">Sapir-Whorf Effect</a>:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Determinism</dt><dd>The doctrine that events are determined completely by previously existing causes. Determinism suggests that only one course of events is possible given the materialist configuration of the Universe at a given time t.</dd>

<dt>Metaphysical Free Will (MFW)</dt><dd>The doctrine that agents are able to make decisions independently of external factors. MFW is false.</dd>
<dt>Hard Determinism</dt><dd>The doctrine that <i>all</i> events, including human action, are ultimately determined by causes external to the will of agents. In other words, Determinism is true, and MFW is false. Since MFW is false, Hard Determinism is effectively the same thing as Determinism.</dd>
<dt>Libertarian Free Will (LFW)</dt><dd>Determinism does not exist. LFW is the exact opposition of Hard Determinism. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism_(metaphysics)">Libertarian Free Will</a> does not exist in reality, and <a href="../epistemology/free-will#determinism-vs-free-will">it is easily disproven</a>.</dd>
<dt>Compatibilism</dt><dd>The doctrine that Determinism and Metaphysical Free Will both coexist. Whether or not this is true depends on how the terms are defined.</dd>

The evidence overwhelmingly shows that Metaphysical Free Will does not exist:

<li>If the universe wasn&rsquo;t cause-and-effect, that would require that a non-cause could &ldquo;cause something&rdquo;. How could something happen if it wasn&rsquo;t caused to happen?

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-why-life-is-selfish">
<p>
Selfishness must ultimately be defended using evolutionary reasoning, but Ayn Rand didn&rsquo;t use any <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/04/altruism-and-selfishness.html">evolutionary reasoning to defend selfishness and explain why altruism is self-defeating</a>.
</p>

<p>
Humans will go to any length justify themselves, their values, and their actions for selfish reasons, even if doing so is hypocritical. Rationalizing is only anti-virtuous and irrational thing when dealing with things that don&rsquo;t pertain to value knowledge (i.e. ethics and axiology). Rationalizing in ethics and axiology is natural, not anti-virtuous. Rand condemns this rationalizing as &ldquo;irrational&rdquo;, even though it&rsquo;s both natural and a consequence of evolution. Instead, it would be better to accept that it&rsquo;s natural, to understand the underlying evolutionary reasoning for why people do it, and to recognize that this is one reason why <a href="#objective-morality-nonsense">morality is an illusion</a>.

<h3 id="emotions"><span class="section-number-3">4.2.</span> The True Nature Of Emotions And <i>Why</i> They Exist</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-emotions">
<p>
Emotions exist to make people better at reproducing and raising offspring. Emotions are needed to generate actions in the real world. Note that I am <i>not</i> saying here that we should put emotions before reasoning, or anything like that. I&rsquo;m only explaining why animals evolved to have emotions, and the function of emotions, which Ayn Rand failed to do.
</p>

<p>
For example, romantic love does not exist merely to make you feel good or to be an expression of your feeling. Love exists because it made our ancestors more efficient at procreating and raising children who would live to adulthood to have children of their own. In the past, male and female organisms who didn&rsquo;t have love or strong emotional bonds towards each other were less likely to stay together to raise their offspring, which endangered their offspring&rsquo;s probability of survival. On the other hand, animals who did evolve to a capacity to romantically love one another were more likely to stick together to protect their children from accidents and predators, thus increasing their reproductive success.
</p>

<p>
More generally, pain and pleasure are biological motivators that were evolutionarily developed to trigger and provide impetus for sentient organisms to do things that sustain their lives and reproduction.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Another thing that Rand has overlooked is that reason isn&rsquo;t necessarily the <b>only</b> valid source of knowledge since emotions are a source of value knowledge when it comes to ethics. Natural instincts such as a fear of spiders and falling from high heights should also be considered knowledge. They indicate that such things threaten our odds of survival.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-race-denialism">
<p>
<b>Race Realism</b> is a subcategory of Biological Realism. Being a race realist means acknowledging that:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Race</b> is defined as &ldquo;a statistical cluster of genetic variation characterized by phenotypic similarity&rdquo;, and</li>
<li>All the genes of the various races in the world occur at different statistical frequencies for each race due to all the different evolutionary and selectionary pressures that persisted in their ancestral environments for many thousands of years, and</li>
<li>Race is a categorization scheme for human beings based on phenotypic similarity.</li>
<li>A race is a descriptive category of things, not a subject (more on that below).</li>
</ol>
<p>
That&rsquo;s it. But you have to understand what a &ldquo;statistical cluster&rdquo; is and what that means with regards to race and genetics, and that racial differences are often continuous. <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#not-racists-nazis-supremacists">Race Realism ≠ Racism</a>.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
A race is a descriptive category of things.
Just because I can assign people into descriptive categories, it does not follow that those categories will interact with the world as units. In general, they won&rsquo;t.
It would be very difficult to act on Europeans as a class, just as it would be very difficult to act on all left-handed men over 6 feet tall. Neither class meets the criteria for an object.
A rock is an object that can be acted upon as a unit. It has internal coherence by its nature.
A race is not an object; it has no internal coherence.
</p>

<p>
Likewise a race is not a subject. It has no will or awareness. It does not act in the world.
The white race doesn&rsquo;t have agency any more than the set of all left-handed men over 6 feet tall has agency.
Both are merely descriptive categories to which individuals can be assigned.
That&rsquo;s why it is stupid to blame whites as a class for such things as slavery and colonialism.
White people never did anything as a unit.
There were various individuals and social groups doing various things, the net result of which included such outcomes as slavery, colonialism and the expansion of European populations into the Western Hemisphere.

<p>
<b>Wrong.</b> The consequences of overpopulation are: global civilizational collapse, <i>billions</i> of people dying, and a permanent dark age. So yes, if you think those things are undesirable (as most people do), then there <i>is</i> a reasonable and &ldquo;moral&rdquo; basis for regulating how many children people can have.
</p>

<p>
If we don&rsquo;t regulate reproduction, then we are destined to face the largest, most catastrophic overpopulation event in history, followed by the largest <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html">famines and wars ever seen before in human history</a>.

<h3 id="immortal-robot-wrong-conclusions"><span class="section-number-3">4.5.</span> The Immortal Robot Thought Experiment Arrives At The Wrong Conclusions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-immortal-robot-wrong-conclusions">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
A simpler thought experiment that arrives at the same conclusions and provides better insight would be to imagine a universe that has no sentient life at all. This thought experiment takes less explaining to get the point across, and it is more readily apparent that all value ultimately originates from sentient life, hence a universe with no sentient life is a universe with no value at all.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
If there is no sentient life in the universe, then there is no Value either. It follows that all Value ultimately originates from sentient beings and their perspectives on reality. Since Value is necessarily perspective-dependent from the viewpoint of sentient being(s), it is thus impossible for Value to be objective by the definition of &ldquo;Objective&rdquo;.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>This proves that all value is subjective, since value originates from sentient organisms, and different organisms have different values. &ldquo;Objective Value&rdquo; is an oxymoron.</li>
<li>Morality is based on value, <a href="https://stateofthenihil.wordpress.com/2019/09/22/reason-is-not-the-basis-for-morality/">not reason</a>. If objective value doesn&rsquo;t exist, then it is necessarily the case that objective morality cannot exist either. Morality is therefore subjective since it is based on Value, which is based on the perspectives(s) of sentient life.</li>
<li>It is true that most humans intuitively derive their purpose and meaning from doing things that sustain their lives (<a href="../misc/industrial-society-and-its-future-manifesto#power-process">the power process</a>), but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make it the objective purpose in life for all humans.</li>
</ol>
<p>
There is no uniquely rational way to define value philosophically. To illustrate this, if we were to ask: &ldquo;What is the best theory of value?&rdquo;, then we would need a theory of value in order to answer the question because it&rsquo;s a normative question. But we can&rsquo;t use a theory of value to answer the question if we haven&rsquo;t already established the right theory value that we should use. This infinite regress demonstrates that there is no foundation for value in philosophy.
</p>

<p>
At most, we can define a theory of value and use it to justify itself, hence why <a href="../epistemology/axiology#reproduction-objective-purpose">life and reproduction are intuitively good values</a>. But that still doesn&rsquo;t conclude that life is the objective value. As a counter-example, Efilists could value exterminating all the life on Planet Earth, and <a href="../misc/case-against-efilism#argument-for-efilism">they could justify it with reasons that many people would find appealing</a>.
</p>

<p>
Since the conclusions made by the Immortal Robot are less useful and more complicated, it doesn&rsquo;t contribute anything new to Philosophy.

Although a lot of the political philosophy ends up the same in the end, and it is important to understand the different reasoning that arrived at these conclusions.
</p>

<p>
It is also a <b>huge</b> mistake to view morality as black and white. Even if morality were objective, there&rsquo;s always more ways to be wrong than there are ways to be right, so anybody who <b>thinks</b> that they are abiding by supposedly objective moral standards is probably wrong. Many people would also use their belief that they are imposing the one and only true &ldquo;objective&rdquo; morality as a justification to rule with an iron fist.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
There&rsquo;s no such thing as collective entities. There&rsquo;s only individuals.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is demonstrably false. Objectivists just define &ldquo;collective entity&rdquo; as something that is impossible to exist, but it&rsquo;s obviously useful to think about and understand the world as having much more than just individual entities, so the mantra falls apart pretty quickly. Basic examples of collective entities (e.g. the United States government, Ford Motors, the Free Software Foundation, etc) and examples of collective values among those collective entities are enough to prove that collective entities and collective values <i>do</i> exist. Asserting otherwise is just parroting of religious moral dogmas.

Most Libertarians are inclined to insist that race doesn&rsquo;t matter, that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s only individuals&rdquo;, that <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs">race realism</a> is pseudo-science, and that race and genetics don&rsquo;t matter for how individualistic, intelligent, hard-working a person can be, but there are several problems with believing this:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It would be contradictory to simultaneously understand evolutionary theory, to insist that racial differences don&rsquo;t matter, and to refuse to apply evolutionary theory under the ideological dogma that racial differences shouldn&rsquo;t matter.

<li><a href="../#fake-research">Most academic research is fake</a>, so whatever academia has to say race realism cannot be trusted, since their conclusions are already decided beforehand by ideological biases, perverse incentives, statistical manipulation, etc.</li>

There is plenty of evidence to prove that genes are the main factor controlling how individualist a person&rsquo;s personality is. In the serotonin transporter gene for example, East Asians are significantly more likely to have the short &ldquo;S&rdquo; allele compared to Europeans who are relatively more likely to have the longer &ldquo;L&rdquo; allele, which may be a contributing factor to the more collectivist culture in East Asia versus the more individualist culture in Europe. <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2009.1650">Source</a>

The foremost goal of government is to resolve Prisoner Dilemmas and Tragedies of the Commons. Government comes from the necessity to create a reasonable set of laws that would create a societal framework from which selfish individuals can cooperate together for greater mutual gain (than if they didn&rsquo;t cooperate together). Cooperation is the foundation of civilization, and the best legal code is the one that enables that to the greatest extent possible.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-why-everybody-owns-land-equally">
<p>
If someone steals something and sells it to someone else, then the transaction is not valid because people cannot trade things that they don&rsquo;t rightfully own, and that property has to be returned to the original owner. Similarly, it makes no sense to buy, sell, and trade land since all land was eventually stolen at some point by the ancestors of one of the people making the trade.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
But if a landowner has to pay taxes on their land, then they don&rsquo;t truly own it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Correct, they don&rsquo;t truly own it. The rightful owners of the Earth&rsquo;s land is (collectively) everybody:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If someone steals something and sells it to someone else, then the transaction is not valid, because people cannot trade things that they don&rsquo;t legally own.</li>
<li>If stolen property is used within a transaction, then the transaction is invalid, and the property has to be returned to the original owner.</li>
<li>All land was stolen at some point in human history.</li>
<li>All landowners either stole their land from someone else, or they bought their land from someone who bought/inherit/stole it from someone else who got it from someone else and so on. The last person at the final end of the transaction stole that land.</li>
<li>Before land was ever privately owned by anybody, land was not owned by anybody, which is essentially the same as everybody owning the land equally.</li>
<li>Everybody was therefore the original owners of the Earth&rsquo;s land.</li>
<li>If the land was initially stolen, but also passed onto today&rsquo;s owners through a combination of inheritance, theft, and trade, none of those transactions were valid because stolen property was used in the transactions, as established in [1].</li>
<li>The land should therefore be returned to its original owners: Everybody.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Occupying land prevents other people from using it. If land is owned equally, then a person who fences off land to prevent other people from using it (without giving due compensation) is effectively stealing that land from the commons.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
But if everybody owns land equally, then that must be the same thing as nobody owning any land at all?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Technically yes, but that does not constitute an argument against equitable land ownership. Georgism still solves the Tragedy of the Commons with respect to land because Georgism explicitly allows <i>private</i> possession of land.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-LVT">
<p>
The only reason why Ayn Rand was ever opposed to taxation in the first place was because it deprives people of the fruits of their labor. Land Value Tax is not a true tax because LVT doesn&rsquo;t deprive people of the fruits of their labor (when only the unimproved value of the land is taxed, otherwise it would be called a property tax).
</p>

<p>
When I first connected these two facts in my mind, I had to seriously question why I was against Land Value Tax at all in the first place, and this created cognitive dissonance for me.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Taxation is slavery with extra steps if it deprives people of the fruits of their Labor.</li>
<li>Land is not created by Labor.</li>
</ol>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-equal-negative-land-rights">
<p>
Having an equal right to land is a negative right and is necessary for a truly free-market economy, and this can be proven via multiple different argument: <a href="../civilization/case-against-libertarianism#GTP-vs-OATP">GeoLibertarian Arguments</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Georgist Theory of Property (GTP) can be stated using the following syllogistic reasoning:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Every person owns themself.</li>
<li>Every person thus owns the labor that they produce.</li>
<li>Every person thus owns anything produced by their labor.</li>
<li>People can trade things that they create with their labor for things that other people create with their labor.</li>
<li>Land is not created by labor.</li>
<li>But land is necessary in order to be productive (because it&rsquo;s one of the three factors of production: land, labor, and capital).</li>
<li>In order for everybody to have an equal right to be productive<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>, everybody must have an equal right to land.</li>
<li>In order to have a free-market economy, everybody must have an equal right to be productive<sup><a id="fnr.2.100" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>, otherwise the economy is anti-free-market.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b><b>Conclusion:</b></b> In order to have a truly free-market economy, everybody must have an equal right to land. Likewise, no one should have unchecked ownership of land because they did not create the land, lest the economy be anti-free-market.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-net-negative-to-civilization">
<p>
Although Rand was a harsh critic of Anarcho-Capitalism, many of her followers are Anarcho-Capitalists since Objectivist Ethics are a gateway into believing in Anarcho-Capitalism. Anarcho-Capitalists are just as ignorant about human nature as Communists are, and their political ideology is equally dangerous to Modern Civilization. Many of them will be reading this critique, so this has to be addressed.
</p>

<p>
The Anarcho-Objectivists are a case of <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/07/status-pyramid-schemes.html">purity spiraling among the Objectivist community</a>. For that reason, Objectivism is a net-negative to civilization because Ancaps are more opposed to Georgism than literally every other political ideology out there. They are thus <a href="../economics/georgism-crash-course">the greatest opponents to solving the greatest economic problems that are facing the modern world</a>. So although Objectivism advocates for a pro-free-market philosophy, it ironically (albeit indirectly) promotes an extremely anti-free market philosophy since <a href="../civilization/case-against-libertarianism#free-markets-circular-reasoning">it&rsquo;s not possible to have free markets at all without a government to establish them</a>, nor is it possible to have <a href="#equal-negative-land-rights">free markets without equal negative land rights for everybody</a>.

<div id="outline-container-conclusion" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="conclusion"><span class="section-number-2">6.</span> Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-conclusion">
<p>
In my experience, Objectivists don&rsquo;t tend to be deep-thinkers or good philosophers.
In most online circles, they tend to parrot quotes and definitions verbatim or fight over typical political questions, without doing any actual thinking.
When other people do rightfully point out the flaws in Objectivism, the Objectivists typically respond by turning the discussion into a debate over why they think their <a href="#sloppy-definitions">poorly thought out definitions</a> are better than the opposition&rsquo;s because they don&rsquo;t know how to think outside the semantic framework that they learned.
It confuses them when other people can or when other people don&rsquo;t use the same definitions as they do.
It&rsquo;s understandable why some people would think like this if they&rsquo;re young and don&rsquo;t have much exposure to better philosophy, but if someone is truly intelligent and able to question the philosophy&rsquo;s assumptions, then they&rsquo;ll eventually reject it, just as I had done in my early 20s.
</p>



<p>
Objectivists usually discover Objectivism by reading Ayn Rand&rsquo;s fiction novels, and people who are introduced to philosophy via that way tend to not be intellectuals to begin with, statistically speaking. Deeper philosophical thinkers either do their own serious thinking, and/or they read expository works to introduce themselves to other ideas. There&rsquo;s also a filter effect at play here too. The smarter Objectivists don&rsquo;t tend to stay Objectivists forever, so they eventually reject the philosophy just like I did, and the pool of actual intellectuals (if any) within the Objectivist Community grows ever smaller.
</p>

<p>
It is a shame that tens of millions of dollars are wasted every year promoting Objectivism by the Ayn Rand Institute and the Atlas Society, when all that money could be spent promoting quality philosophy and creating truly rational thinkers for tackling the greatest problems of the 21st century.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, <a href="#intro">I do agree with Objectivism on this list of bullet points</a> that I wrote in the introduction. Although I&rsquo;m clearly not a fan of Ayn Rand&rsquo;s philosophy, I would say that she had a better philosophy than most of the humans or philosophers who had ever lived prior to the creation of the Internet.
