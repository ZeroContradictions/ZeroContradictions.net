<h2 id="intro"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Introduction To This Critique</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
Most criticisms against Objectivism focus on Rand&rsquo;s support for selfishness, her condemnation of altruism, and her support for Capitalism and Libertarian principles.
They are naive and misguided about human nature, but this essay is not your typical critique of Objectivism.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s impossible to talk about all the problems with Objectivism in a single essay, especially for a philosophy that&rsquo;s described over multiple books and hundreds of pages.
It&rsquo;s also redundant when I have already written about these topics in depth on other webpages.
For these reasons, most of the sections on this page only give a short introduction into their respective topics, while linking to other webpages that talk about these issues in sufficient depth, compared to what&rsquo;s being displayed here.
</p>


<p>
To provide context and to present Ayn Rand&rsquo;s and Leonard Peikoff&rsquo;s views accurately, there are quotations from their works throughout this essay.
If anybody thinks that I am misrepresenting Objectivism, please message me and explain why via <a href="../misc/contact">my contact page</a>.
My goal is to present the Objectivist philosophy (as described by Rand and Peikoff) correctly, not to misrepresent it.
I&rsquo;m only interested in what&rsquo;s true. I accept what&rsquo;s true, and I reject what&rsquo;s false.
</p>

<p>
Some people may believe that the criticisms on this page may boil down to semantic disagreements with Objectivist terms.
Even if this is arguably the case, we still insist that the language that we&rsquo;re using here is better than the Objectivist jargon because we believe that it is more conducive to describing a rational philosophy.
Many of these semantic details are likely to influence how we think about philosophy because <a href="../language/sapir-whorf-theory">language is very vulnerable to the Sapir-Whorf Effect</a>, so it&rsquo;s important to be as careful with our language as possible.
</p>

<p>
Now we shall begin the critique.

<div id="outline-container-valid-conclusions" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="valid-conclusions"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Valid Conclusions Made By Objectivism</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-valid-conclusions">
<p>
Compared to most philosophers, Rand was one of the best to have existed up to her lifetime.
She identified many good positions:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There is no such thing as supernatural phenomena (including a supernatural God).</li>
<li>The primacy of existence before consciousness.</li>
<li>All knowledge of reality originates from the senses.</li>
<li>The integration of Empiricism and Rationalism.</li>
<li>She had a good theory of concept formation, empiricism, existents, percepts, and concepts. She makes some mistakes, but it&rsquo;s otherwise spot-on.</li>
<li>Reason is the only valid source of (sensory) knowledge, and a human&rsquo;s tool of survival.</li>
<li>Rationality must be applied to all aspects of one&rsquo;s life.</li>
<li>She asserted that people should think for themselves, rather than being <a href="http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/second-handers.html">second-handers</a>.</li>
<li>All life is (or should be) selfish. However, we justify this differently. Mine is more sound since <a href="#why-life-is-selfish">it uses biological and evolutionary reasoning</a>.</li>
<li>Free markets and negative rights are good policies for a society.</li>
<li>Her proposed virtues of: independence, integrity, honesty, justice, productiveness, egoism (or selfishness as she calls it), and pride are good virtues, aside from how <a href="#objectivism-virtues">all their descriptions inherit the flaws of her imperfect theory of value and moral assumptions</a>.</li>
<li>She probably didn&rsquo;t realize it, but Objectivism has had considerable influence as an ideology because it has good memetic properties, especially with how it markets itself as a &ldquo;philosophy for life on Earth&rdquo;. I support using memetics for spreading rationality and the <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/04/toward-rational-humanism.html">Rational Humanism value system</a>.</li>
</ol>

<hr>
<p>
Unfortunately, Rand also made many errors in her philosophy.
Ayn Rand was more of a novelist who became a philosopher.
The goal of writing her philosophy was to justify the ideas in her novels.
I believe that most of the errors of Objectivism with respect to axiology and political philosophy arose because Objectivism was created to justify a <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-communists-who-took-power-in.html">utopian ideology</a>, rather than being an honest and informed attempt to understand human nature and the human condition.
On the other hand, I think most of the errors regarding epistemology are just a result from not thinking about it enough.
To be fair, epistemology is a very difficult field to think about or study.

<div id="outline-container-axioms-problems" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="axioms-problems"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> The Problems With Ayn Rand&rsquo;s Axioms</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-axioms-problems">
<div class="opponent" id="org4451aa5">
<p>
An axiom is a statement that identifies the base of knowledge and of any further statement pertaining to that knowledge, a statement necessarily contained in all others, whether any particular speaker chooses to identify it or not. An axiom is a proposition that defeats its opponents by the fact that they have to accept it and use it in the process of any attempt to deny it.
&#x2013; Galt&rsquo;s Speech, For the New Intellectual, 155
</p>

</div>
<p>
This is <i>not</i> the standard definition of &ldquo;axiom&rdquo; that most people use.
Compare Rand&rsquo;s definition above with how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom">Wikipedia</a> and most dictionaries define &ldquo;axiom&rdquo;:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
These definitions are not the same because true axioms aren&rsquo;t necessarily supposed to &ldquo;identify the base of knowledge&rdquo;.
Nor are axioms required to &ldquo;defeat their opponents by the fact that they have to accept it and use it in the process of any attempt to deny it&rdquo;.
Axioms are synonymous with &ldquo;assumptions&rdquo; or &ldquo;premises&rdquo;.
Since axioms already have a standard definition that is quite different from the one than Ayn Rand is using, it would&rsquo;ve been more appropriate for her to call them &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performative_contradiction">performative contradictions</a>&rdquo;, since that&rsquo;s what they actually are, in standard English language.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, Rand argues that propositions that can be proven by performative contradictions are implicit in all statements.
This is true to the extent that they are implied by self-contradiction, but this doesn&rsquo;t mean that humans are compelled to accept them because <i>anything</i> can be questioned.
In order to be rational, people have to <i>choose</i> to be rational.
There is nothing that compels people to accept the results of a proof by performative contradiction.
There are plenty of people who do so, however irrational it may be.
However, that is not to say that we argue against the validity of statements proving by performative contradictions.
<a href="../epistemology/performative-contradictions">We endorse them</a>, but we want to be very clear about what they are.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="org72ec6a7">
<p>
An axiomatic concept is the identification of a primary fact of reality, which cannot be analyzed, i.e., reduced to other facts or broken into component parts. It is implicit in all facts and in all knowledge. It is the fundamentally given and directly perceived or experienced, which requires no proof or explanation, but on which all proofs and explanations rest.<br>
The first and primary axiomatic concepts are &ldquo;existence,&rdquo; &ldquo;identity&rdquo; (which is a corollary of &ldquo;existence&rdquo;) and &ldquo;consciousness.&rdquo;
&#x2013; Axiomatic Concepts, Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, 55
</p>

</div>
<p>
Rand&rsquo;s goal was to identify the base for knowledge, which she partially accomplished through her support for empiricism and rationality being the only valid sources of knowledge, and the concepts of existence, consciousness, identity, causality, etc that she identified.
However, she still fell short on multiple points:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Once you have experience, the <a href="../epistemology/performative-contradictions">Axioms of Classical Logic</a> are a superior set of axioms for epistemology, but they aren&rsquo;t enough to axiomatize <i>all</i> of epistemology. Regardless, they actually count as real axioms, by the standard definition that&rsquo;s actually used in dictionaries.</li>
<li><a href="../epistemology/performative-contradictions#axioms-and-basic-theorems">There are many other performative contradictions that can be made</a> besides the ones that she identified.</li>
<li>Supposedly, the Law of Non-Contradiction (LNC) is a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corollary#Noun">corollary</a> of the Identity Axiom. It would be more appropriate to establish the LNC as a separate axiom. In order to conclude the LNC from the Identity Axiom, you would have to assume (or implicitly assume) what you&rsquo;re trying to prove.</li>
<li>It would be more appropriate to establish existence and consciousness as corollaries of the Axioms of Classical Logic instead, since they are proven using performative contradiction proofs.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Axioms must also be as parsimonious as possible.
The goal is to derive as much knowledge as possible from as few propositions as possible.
Knowledge is information compression.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-assumptions" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="assumptions"><span class="section-number-3">3.2.</span> Logic, Causality, and Assumptions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-assumptions">
<div class="opponent" id="org2d1b330">
<p>
[A man&rsquo;s] means to establish the truth of his answers is logic, and logic rests on the axiom that existence exists. Logic is the art of non-contradictory identification. A contradiction cannot exist.
&#x2013; Galt&rsquo;s Speech, For the New Intellectual, 125
</p>

</div>
<p>
Logic does follow from the existence axiom.
Logic exists because it&rsquo;s built into how humans think.
It&rsquo;s not possible for humans to think without assuming the laws of logic, even if they don&rsquo;t know them or aren&rsquo;t using them explicitly.
The ability to use and understand logic is <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/08/theories-of-knowledge.html">procedural knowledge</a>.
</p>

<p>
The induction and understanding of the laws of causality, logic, time, etc can gradually become more explicit and formal as the subject continues to learn, think, and formalize these laws in a formal language.
You can and should acknowledge reality and existence <i>before formalizing</i> the laws of classical logic, but you do <i>not</i> have to do so before <i>using</i> logic.
</p>


<div class="opponent" id="org279df07">
<p>
The law of causality is the law of identity applied to action. All actions are caused by entities. The nature of an action is caused and determined by the nature of the entities that act; a thing cannot act in contradiction to its nature . . . . The law of identity does not permit you to have your cake and eat it, too. The law of causality does not permit you to eat your cake before you have it.
&#x2013; Galt&rsquo;s Speech, For the New Intellectual, 151
</p>

</div>
<p>
Causality is not derived from the identity axiom.
Causality is a property of the universe.
So much so that human cognition evolved to think about causality automatically. Same with time.
There&rsquo;s no way for a human to ever think without implicitly assuming the existence of time and causality.
We cannot escape them because <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/05/what-is-subjectivity.html">we cannot escape our subjectivity</a>.
</p>


<div class="opponent" id="org8ae6f88">
<p>
As a philosophical detective, you must remember that nothing is self-evident except the material of sensory perception—and that an irreducible primary is a fact which cannot be analyzed (i.e. broken into components) or derived from antecedent facts.
You must examine your own convictions and any idea or theory you study, by asking: Is this an irreducible primary—and, if not, what does it depend on?
You must ask the same question about any answer you obtain, until you do come to an irreducible primary: if a given idea contradicts a primary, the idea is false.
This process will lead you to the field of metaphysics and epistemology—and you will discover in what way every aspect of man&rsquo;s knowledge depends on that field and stands or falls with it.

<p>
Many philosophies aim to affirm assumptions instead of questioning them.
Unfortunately, Objectivism has also failed to live up to its proclamation that all ideas and theories should be questioned, as we shall see in the rest of this essay.
An example is how <a href="#life-is-not-ultimate-value">Objectivists affirm life as being an objective or &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; value</a>, without questioning it further.
Since many Objectivists are only interested in having some guidelines by which to live their lives, many of them are not interested in questioning their assumptions or <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2016/07/what-is-abyss.html">exploring the Abyss</a>.

Since man has no automatic knowledge, he can have no automatic values; since he has no innate ideas, he can have no innate value judgments.

Objectivism is correct to embrace empiricism, and it proposes a good theory for how concepts are constructed.
However, Objectivism proposes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundationalism">foundationalist</a> theory of knowledge, rather than a coherentist theory.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-subject-object-dichotomy">
<p>
I can&rsquo;t state enough just how important it is to understand the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity_and_objectivity_(philosophy)">Subject | Object Dichotomy</a> and its implications if one wishes to form a rational, accurate, and coherent philosophy.
It will <i>not</i> be possible to fully comprehend the metaphysical, epistemological, or axiological criticisms made in this essay if the reader does not understand the dichotomy.
</p>

<p>
First we need to clarify some definitions.
Objectivists define &ldquo;objective&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;grounded in reality&rdquo; and they define &ldquo;subjective&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;not grounded in reality&rdquo;.
<b>The primary meaning of &ldquo;objective&rdquo; in this essay has a completely different meaning</b> that is reserved to talk about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity_and_objectivity_(philosophy)">philosophical objects</a> in the context of the subject | object dichotomy.
The meaning of &ldquo;subjective&rdquo; in this essay is also completely different from the Objectivists&rsquo; notion, and it is used to refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_and_object_(philosophy)">philosophical subjects</a>.
The reader should keep these definitions in mind while reading the essay.
</p>

<p>
A subject is a being who has a unique consciousness (will and awareness) and/or unique personal experiences, or an entity that has a relationship with another entity that exists outside itself (an object).
A subject has a mind.
Something is &ldquo;subjective&rdquo; if it is mind-dependent or perspective-dependent.
Subjectivity is not random or arbitrary.
Subjectivity is a concept for describing properties of the mind, like <a href="../epistemology/representationalism">knowledge</a>, <a href="#truth">truth</a>, <a href="#emotions">emotions</a>, <a href="../epistemology/axiology">value</a>, <a href="../epistemology/determinism">will</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness">awareness</a>, etc.
</p>

<p>
A subject can be <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2018/01/views.html">viewed</a> as both a subject <i>and</i> an object.
An object is a philosophical term often used in contrast to the term <i>subject</i>.
A subject is an observer and an object is a thing observed.
Philosophy and psychology are the self thinking about itself.
This is achieved by viewing <i>subjects</i> from the perspective as if they were <i>objects</i>.

Determinism is the theory that everything that happens in the universe—including every thought, feeling, and action of man—is necessitated by previous factors, so that nothing could ever have happened differently from the way it did, and everything in the future is already pre-set and inevitable. Every aspect of man&rsquo;s life and character, on this view, is merely a product of factors that are ultimately outside his control. Objectivism rejects this theory.

However, we can conclude that Rand and most of her followers are likely to reject physicalism since Objectivism rejects determinism.
Since Objectivism rejects physicalism, it&rsquo;s not clear how it would resolve the Hard Problem of Consciousness.

Leonard Peikoff has written about this topic, so I shall critique his claims.
I prefer the term &ldquo;physicalist&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;materialist&rdquo; since the latter is sometimes used to describe a consumerist ideology, but Peikoff used the term &ldquo;materialism&rdquo;, so I shall use both terms in this section.

Ayn Rand describes materialists as &ldquo;mystics of muscle&rdquo;— &ldquo;mystics&rdquo; because, like idealists, they reject the faculty of reason. Man, they hold, is essentially a body without a mind. His conclusions, accordingly, reflect not the objective methodology of reason and logic, but the blind operation of physical factors, such as atomic dances in the cerebrum, glandular squirtings, S-R conditioning, or the tools of production moving in that weird, waltzlike contortion known as the dialectic process.

Materialism is not mysticism, nor does it requiring viewing Man as a &ldquo;body without a mind&rdquo;.

As objects, our consciousness is ultimately a biochemical system of atoms and molecules.

The materialist equation of physics with science is equally groundless.
Science is systematic knowledge gained by the use of reason based on observation.
In using reason, however, one must study each specific subject matter by the methods and techniques suited to its nature.
One cannot study history by the methods of chemistry, biology by the methods of economics, or psychology by the methods of physics.
At the dawn of philosophy, the ancient Pythagoreans in an excess of enthusiasm attempted, senselessly, to equate mathematics with cognition and to construe the universe as &ldquo;numbers.&rdquo; The modern behaviorists, with far less excuse, commit the same error in regard to physics.

<p>
What is the meaning of the concept &ldquo;truth&rdquo;? Truth is the recognition of reality. (This is known as the correspondence theory of truth.) The same thing cannot be true and untrue at the same time and in the same respect.
&#x2013; &ldquo;Philosophical Detection&rdquo;, Philosophy: Who Needs It, 14
</p>

</div>

<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_theory_of_truth">Correspondence Theory of Truth</a> is not a valid theory of knowledge because it doesn&rsquo;t explain how ideas in the mind <i>relate</i> to reality.
Beliefs don&rsquo;t <i>correspond</i> to reality.
That&rsquo;s naive.
They <i>represent</i> reality, from our perspective as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_and_object_(philosophy)">subject</a>.
</p>

<p>
For example, it was considered &ldquo;true&rdquo; hundreds of years ago that the Sun revolved around the Earth.
Everyone was as strongly convinced that that was a fact as we are now of the opposite belief.
Would a Geocentrist be accurate if he confidently claimed that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model">Geocentrism</a> <i>corresponds</i> to reality?
Of course not (from our perspective).
Instead, what can be accurately said from both perspectives is that the belief that the Sun revolves around the Earth <i>represents</i> reality from the perspective of the people who believe it.
Even though Geocentrism may seem unreasonable to most people today, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model">there were seemingly good reasons</a> why people used to believe in it in the past.
Even if a person disagrees with Geocentrism, most people would agree that the reasons given for believing in it are still valid observations about reality.
</p>

<p>
If a person believes in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinates_(astronomy)">barycentric coordinates</a> theory, then they would judge the Geocentrism theory to be false.
They are using a different model of reality to make that judgment.
I believe in the barycentric coordinates theory, and that theory <i>represents</i> reality to me, <i>from my perspective</i>.
</p>

<p>
I could claim that barycentric coordinates corresponds to reality, but what does that mean?
In practice, people who say &ldquo;X corresponds to reality&rdquo; are essentially saying &ldquo;I think X is true&rdquo;.
This is problematic because saying &ldquo;X is true&rdquo; is also defined as &ldquo;X corresponds to reality&rdquo;.
The so-called &ldquo;correspondence&rdquo; is not well-defined.
People can&rsquo;t even agree on what the &ldquo;correct correspondences&rdquo; to reality are.
</p>

<p>
A proper theory of knowledge has to explain why a Geocentrist judges the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinates_(astronomy)">barycentric coordinates</a> theory to be false.
The answer is that a geocentrist and a proponent for barycentric coordinates both have different models of reality.
Each person believes that their model of reality is true knowledge.
To each person, their knowledge <i>represents</i> reality, from their perspective.
That&rsquo;s possible because knowledge is subjective.

The problem with the Correspondence Theory of Truth/Knowledge is that it does not use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_and_object_(philosophy)">subject | object dichotomy</a> to describe what knowledge is.
Contrary to popular belief, Truth is <i>not</i> objective.

Truth is the identification of a fact of reality. Whether the fact in question is metaphysical or man-made, the fact determines the truth: if the fact exists, there is no alternative in regard to what is true.

</p>

</div>
<p>
This doesn&rsquo;t explain anything.
Facts are the same thing as Truths, so this is a circular definition of &ldquo;truth&rdquo;.
Moreover, the word &ldquo;fact&rdquo; is naive, because it assumes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity_and_objectivity_(philosophy)">objective</a> truth.
In ordinary usage, that&rsquo;s fine because we take a lot of things for granted in ordinary discourse.
But that&rsquo;s not okay in philosophy, because we&rsquo;re not taking truth for granted in an epistemological context.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="orgf2fd9f0">
<p>
A fact is a metaphysical concept referencing what is, independent of what we currently know.<br>
Truth is an epistemological concept, it&rsquo;s an evaluation of your judgments using correspondence to facts as the standard.<br>
Facts pertain to reality, while &ldquo;truth&rdquo; pertains to statements.
</p>

</div>
<p>
If truth pertains to statements (which includes facts), and facts pertain to reality, then truth also pertains to reality.
So &ldquo;truth&rdquo; and &ldquo;fact&rdquo; both still mean the same thing.
Another thing is that nobody can agree on what all the &ldquo;facts&rdquo; are or what the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; is, and not everybody can be right if they believe in different positions.
This suggests that facts and truth are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjectivity_and_objectivity_(philosophy)">subjective, not objective</a>.
What people assert to be &ldquo;true&rdquo; is always the same thing as what they <i>know</i> or <i>think</i> is true, so &ldquo;truth&rdquo; is de facto the same thing as knowledge.

As a final note, Objectivists tend to argue that people shouldn&rsquo;t spend/waste their time doing things if they don&rsquo;t perceive it to benefit them.

<h3 id="intersubjectivity"><span class="section-number-3">4.4.</span> Intersubjectivity Isn&rsquo;t Emphasized Enough</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-intersubjectivity">
<p>
It seems that Ayn Rand and most Objectivists would agree that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersubjectivity">intersubjectivity</a> is a valid concept, even if they don&rsquo;t use the term specifically.
Nevertheless, the point of this section is that intersubjectivity is an important concept for explaining reality, and I don&rsquo;t believe that Objectivism emphasizes it or has made it explicit enough.
</p>

<p>
Intersubjectivity is similar to subjectivity since it is also mind-dependent, except that it occurs within <i>multiple</i> separate conscious minds.
Intersubjective phenomena are phenomena that exist within (or &ldquo;agree&rdquo;) between multiple minds.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Language is a good example. The English language exists in a distributed way, in the brains of English speakers. It is part of culture. The word &ldquo;tree&rdquo; means what it means because English speakers map it to the same concept in their brains. A language is a system of knowledge that is shared by multiple brains, and used to communicate ideas between those brains.<br>
Money is another example. What makes money valuable is that people believe it has value. If people stopped viewing money as valuable, then it would no longer be valuable. The value of money exists intersubjectively.<br>
Norms of behavior, such as politeness, are another example. In Japan, it is polite to bow when meeting someone. In America, it is polite to look into their eyes and shake their hand. These behaviors are polite because people view them as polite. There is no objective standard of politeness, just different cultural standards.
&#x2013; Blithering Genius, <i><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/05/what-is-subjectivity.html">What is Subjectivity?</a></i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
One of the great strengths of the subject | object dichotomy is that it enables us to clearly understand intersubjectivity.
Objectivism does not recognize that <a href="#language-and-thought">language</a>, money, culture, <a href="#objective-morality-nonsense">morality</a>, and <a href="#purpose-of-government">rights</a> are intersubjective.
Those concepts exist between minds, not within a reality that is outside of human minds.
</p>

<p>
The extent to which one can know what it&rsquo;s like to be another person (or subject) is limited by the amount of intersubjectivity that they share, and one&rsquo;s ability to infer what it&rsquo;s like to be the other subject based on their knowledge and ability to relate similar experiences.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-language-and-thought">
<p>
As established in <a href="#intersubjectivity">the last section</a>, language is intersubjective.
</p>

<p>
In order to persuade someone, an individual must analyze the beliefs and language of the person that they want to persuade.
They must determine how the other person maps words and beliefs between each other and in which contexts.
If done strategically, the individual can preemptively predict how other people will positively or negatively respond to the language that they use, and they can craft their language accordingly to affect the other person&rsquo;s beliefs and predispositions towards what they&rsquo;re talking about.
</p>

<p>
Language thus has a huge potential to influence and affect thought via <a href="../language/sapir-whorf-theory">the Sapir-Whorf Effect</a>.
The linked essay explains how it occurs and shows many applied examples of how that happens in everyday speech.
No philosophy could ever be complete without understanding how language influences our thoughts, what could be done to avoid this, and how we could use our awareness of this phenomenon to think more deeply.

<p>
&ldquo;Arbitrary&rdquo; means a claim put forth in the absence of evidence of any sort, perceptual or conceptual; its basis is neither direct observation nor any kind of theoretical argument. [An arbitrary idea is] a sheer assertion with no attempt to validate it or connect it to reality.
Since an arbitrary statement has no connection to man&rsquo;s means of knowledge or his grasp of reality, cognitively speaking such a statement must be treated as though nothing had been said.<br>
Let me elaborate this point. An arbitrary claim has no cognitive status whatever. According to Objectivism, such a claim is not to be regarded as true or as false. If it is arbitrary, it is entitled to no epistemological assessment at all; it is simply to be dismissed as though it hadn&rsquo;t come up . . . . The truth is established by reference to a body of evidence and within a context; the false is pronounced false because it contradicts the evidence. The arbitrary, however, has no relation to evidence, facts, or context. It is the human equivalent of [noises produced by] a parrot . . . sounds without any tie to reality, without content or significance.<br>
It is not your responsibility to refute someone&rsquo;s arbitrary assertion—to try to find or imagine arguments that will show that his assertion is false. It is a fundamental error on your part even to try to do this. The rational procedure in regard to an arbitrary assertion is to dismiss it out of hand, merely identifying it as arbitrary, and as such inadmissible and undiscussable.
&#x2013; Leonard Peikoff, The Philosophy of Objectivism lecture series
</p>

</div>
<p>
We agree that claims should be dismissed if they have no evidence to support them.
However, a distinction should be made between claims that we could <i>potentially</i> evaluate as subjects, and claims that could only be answered by escaping our subjectivity.
For the former, anybody who asserts a claim without any supporting evidence has the <a href="../epistemology/skepticism-certainty">burden of proof</a>.
For the latter, it is impossible to answer such claims definitively, but it&rsquo;s not rational to dismiss them as &ldquo;undiscussable&rdquo;.
The proper way to deal with questions and claims that pertain to reality outside of all subjectivity is to acknowledge that we&rsquo;ll never know the answers, that we shouldn&rsquo;t try to figure out the answers (because it&rsquo;s impossible), and to carry on with our lives as before.
</p>

<p>
When I say that &ldquo;we cannot know what reality really is&rdquo; or that &ldquo;we cannot escape our subjectivity&rdquo;, what I mean is that we can never truly know what&rsquo;s it like to be someone else, to not be human, or even to not be a subject at all.
For the last case, we have no way of knowing whether we are just brains who each live in a vat, or if we all live in a dream or a simulation.
Our genes limit what aspects we can sense from reality.
For example, most human&rsquo;s genes cause them to only view within the visible light spectrum.
We cannot see other sections of the electromagnetic spectrum with our bare eyes because they are invisible to us.
If we already know that there are some aspects of reality that we cannot sense, then it&rsquo;s reasonable to recognize that it&rsquo;s possible that there are other features of reality that we also cannot sense as well, even with the help of technological equipment.
In order to get to the bottom of these hypothetical questions, we would have to be able to view life <i>outside of our subjectivity</i>, but we&rsquo;ll never be able to do that because that is one of the conditions of being a philosophical subject.
For our practical day to day lives, we can assume that we don&rsquo;t live in a vat, a dream, or a simulation, but if we want to be honest and rigorous, then we would have to say that we will simply never know the answer, and that we shouldn&rsquo;t try to figure out the answer since it&rsquo;s impossible for us to do so.
</p>

<p>
There are many other questions that we&rsquo;ll never be able to answer.
For example, we cannot determine what caused the Universe to exist (i.e. what caused the Big Bang to happen) because any explanation of that would be within a cause-and-effect Universe.
In order to explain it, we would have to prove it within a reality that has no casualty, but that is impossible.

In ethics, one must begin by asking: What are values? Why does man need them?<br>
&ldquo;Value&rdquo; is that which one acts to gain and/or keep. The concept &ldquo;value&rdquo; is not a primary; it presupposes an answer to the question: of value to whom and for what?

Ethics is an objective, metaphysical necessity of man&rsquo;s survival. . . .<br>
I quote from Galt&rsquo;s speech: &ldquo;Man has been called a rational being, but rationality is a matter of choice—and the alternative his nature offers him is: rational being or suicidal animal. Man has to be man—by choice; he has to hold his life as a value—by choice; he has to learn to sustain it—by choice; he has to discover the values it requires and practice his virtues—by choice. A code of values accepted by choice is a code of morality.&rdquo;<br>
The standard of value of the Objectivist ethics—the standard by which one judges what is good or evil—is man&rsquo;s life, or: that which is required for man&rsquo;s survival qua man.<br>
Since reason is man&rsquo;s basic means of survival, that which is proper to the life of a rational being is the good; that which negates, opposes or destroys it is the evil. Since everything man needs has to be discovered by his own mind and produced by his own effort, the two essentials of the method of survival proper to a rational being are: thinking and productive work. &#x2013; &ldquo;The Objectivist Ethics,&rdquo; The Virtue of Selfishness, 23
</p>

</div>
<p>
Reason is not synonymous with morality, nor can reason alone serve as a basis for morality because the true basis for morality is <i>value</i>, not reason.
Moral relativism is a corollary that follows from this.
The subjectivity of morality debunks the entire foundation of the Objectivist theory of ethics, to the point that everything must be re-thought from the ground up.
Although a lot of the political philosophy ends up the same in the end, and it is important to understand the different reasoning that arrived at these conclusions.
<a href="../faqs/morality#technology-and-moral-progress">Most so-called &ldquo;moral progress&rdquo; is only advancements in technology</a>.
</p>

<p>
Irrationality is <i>not</i> the origin of all evil.
&ldquo;Evil&rdquo; people aren&rsquo;t evil because they&rsquo;re irrational.
They&rsquo;re &ldquo;evil&rdquo; because either: 1. <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html">they have to fight against others for scarce resources to survive</a>, or 2. they have <a href="../faqs/morality#when-life-becomes-zero-sum">values that are opposed to other people&rsquo;s perspectives</a>.
Deeming anything &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;evil&rdquo; implies a value judgment of some kind, and we cannot make judgments unless we have already adopted an theory of value beforehand.
Believing that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;immoral&rdquo; to hurt others is an assumption, and it&rsquo;s often necessary in order for individuals to survive in nature (except in a world with non-scarce resources and/or a <a href="#purpose-of-government">society that prohibits such violence via the rule of force</a>).
</p>

<p>
If anything, it&rsquo;s irrational to unilaterally declare anything to be &ldquo;evil&rdquo; or to view morality as black and white because that entails having unquestioned implicit assumptions.
Even if morality were objective, there&rsquo;s always more ways to be wrong than there are ways to be right, so anybody who <i>thinks</i> that they are abiding by supposedly objective moral standards is probably wrong.
Many people would use their belief that they are imposing the one and only true &ldquo;objective&rdquo; morality as a justification to rule with an iron fist.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-ignorance-of-biology">
<p>
Objectivists tend to think that technology and innovation make evolution obsolete, but they are wrong about this.
<a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/02/we-cannot-transcend-evolution.html">Humans cannot transcend evolution</a>.
Humans are a biological species and we were created by evolution, so evolutionary theory applies to us just like all other living things.
For a sufficient understanding of how evolution works, we recommend reading <a href="../#biorealism">the series of essays available at this link</a>.

<h3 id="why-life-is-selfish"><span class="section-number-3">5.1.</span> Understanding <i>Why</i> Life Evolves To Be Selfish</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-why-life-is-selfish">
<p>
You can&rsquo;t understand what selfishness <i>really</i> is until you understand <i>why</i> it exists in the first place.
Hence, selfishness must ultimately be defended using bio-evolutionary reasoning, but Ayn Rand didn&rsquo;t use any <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/04/altruism-and-selfishness.html">evolutionary reasoning to defend selfishness and explain why altruism is self-defeating</a>.
In order to be truly and uncompromisingly selfish, one must reject morality.
It&rsquo;s not enough to say that maximal selfishness must avoid infringing upon other people&rsquo;s rights.
That often isn&rsquo;t an option in a resource-scarce environment.
There&rsquo;s also no reason why someone should avoid infringing upon other people&rsquo;s rights if they know that they won&rsquo;t face any significant game-theoretical consequences, unless they strongly value cooperation and the more prosperous civilization that it would entail.
The game-theoretical evolutionary conception of selfishness is thus more selfish than the Randian conception of selfishness.
</p>

<p>
Humans will go to any length justify themselves, their values, and their actions for selfish reasons, even if doing so is hypocritical.
Rationalizing is only anti-virtuous and irrational thing when dealing with things that don&rsquo;t pertain to value knowledge (i.e. ethics and axiology).
Rationalizing in ethics and axiology is natural, not anti-virtuous.
Rand condemns this rationalizing as &ldquo;irrational&rdquo;, even though it&rsquo;s both natural and a consequence of evolution.
Instead, it would be better to accept that it&rsquo;s natural, to understand the underlying evolutionary reasoning for why people do it, and to recognize that this is one reason why <a href="#objective-morality-nonsense">morality is an illusion</a>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-life-is-violent">
<p>
Objectivists find Objectivism appealing because it fits their moral intuitions and justifies them, <a href="../epistemology/difficult-to-change-minds#hub-and-spoke-networks">within their belief networks</a>.
Objectivism preaches that people should never murder, never steal, and never harm others, and it also proclaims that the good and evil dichotomy is symmetrical to rationality versus irrationality.
But this is not the case.
Objectivism ignores that <a href="../faqs/morality#when-life-becomes-zero-sum">value judgments are both positive <i>and</i> negative</a>, especially when a population of organisms reaches the carrying capacity of its environment.
</p>

<p>
Every human has ancestors that had to kill, rape, and steal in order to be reproductively successful.
None of the humans living on Earth today would exist if that never happened.
Life on Earth is a game where humans kill, rape, and fuck other humans over, and predator eats prey.
This has occur for literally <i>millions</i> of years.
Humans can also cooperate with each other, but they only do when it&rsquo;s in <a href="#purpose-of-government">their self-interest</a>.
This is the reality of Life on Earth.
Objectivists deny reality because they cannot accept that <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html">Life on Earth is intrinsically violent</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/10/competition-in-nature.html">The competitive nature of life</a> ultimately originates from the scarcity of resources on Earth and <a href="../faqs/overpopulation#overpop-game-theory">the tendency of organisms to reproduce to infinity</a>.
Nature selects for selfish, competitive organisms because life evolves to maximize reproductive success.
A successful society can (and must) outlaw murder, theft, and violence within the society, but <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/07/circles-of-control-and-freedom.html">it only does so by redirecting the violence outwards towards other societies and outsiders</a>.
Additionally, just because societies outlaw murder, theft, and other crimes against other members of society, that doesn&rsquo;t conclude that it can&rsquo;t still be within one&rsquo;s self-interest to commit crimes against others, especially if the individual knows that he can get away with it.

<h3 id="emotions"><span class="section-number-3">5.3.</span> The True Nature Of Emotions And <i>Why</i> They Exist</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-emotions">
<div class="opponent" id="org23fa524">
<p>
An emotion as such tells you nothing about reality, beyond the fact that something makes you feel something. Without a ruthlessly honest commitment to introspection—to the conceptual identification of your inner states—you will not discover what you feel, what arouses the feeling, and whether your feeling is an appropriate response to the facts of reality, or a mistaken response, or a vicious illusion produced by years of self-deception . . . .
In the field of introspection, the two guiding questions are: &ldquo;What do I feel?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Why do I feel it?&rdquo;
&#x2013; &ldquo;Philosophical Detection&rdquo;, Philosophy: Who Needs It, 17
</p>

</div>
<p>
Technically, we are part of reality, so emotions do inform us of reality, in terms of <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/02/motivation.html">the biological imperatives that we need to fulfill in order to survive and reproduce</a>.
For example, hunger informs me that my body is low on energy.
Physical pain informs me that part of my body is being damaged.
Emotions exist to make people better at reproducing and raising offspring.
Emotions are needed to generate actions in the real world.
Note that I am <i>not</i> saying here that we should put emotions before reasoning, or anything like that.
I&rsquo;m only explaining <i>why</i> animals evolved to have emotions, and the function of emotions.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="org994d8c0">
<p>
Romantic love, in the full sense of the term, is an emotion possible only to the man (or woman) of unbreached self-esteem: it is his response to his own highest values in the person of another—an integrated response of mind and body, of love and sexual desire. Such a man (or woman) is incapable of experiencing a sexual desire divorced from spiritual values.
&#x2013; &ldquo;Of Living Death&rdquo;, The Voice of Reason, 54
</p>

</div>
<p>
Ayn Rand viewed love from <a href="#subject-object-dichotomy">a subjective point of view, instead of an objective point of view</a>, so she failed to explain why love exists and the purpose that it serves.
Love exists because it made our ancestors more efficient at procreating and raising children who would live to adulthood to have children of their own.
In the past, male and female organisms who didn&rsquo;t have love or strong emotional bonds towards each other were less likely to stay together to raise their offspring, which endangered their offspring&rsquo;s probability of survival.
On the other hand, animals who did evolve to a capacity to romantically love one another were more likely to stick together to protect their children from accidents and predators, thus increasing their reproductive success.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s true that humans can sometimes reprogram their emotions by changing their value judgements, but this cannot be done to a great extent.
Emotions serve biological functions that are often beyond our control.
Emotions are a condition of subjectivity.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="org11d7d25">
<p>
The capacity to experience pleasure or pain is innate in a man&rsquo;s body; it is part of his nature, part of the kind of entity he is. He has no choice about it, and he has no choice about the standard that determines what will make him experience the physical sensation of pleasure or of pain. What is that standard?* His life*.<br>
The pleasure-pain mechanism in the body of man—and in the bodies of all the living organisms that possess the faculty of consciousness—serves as an automatic guardian of the organism&rsquo;s life. The physical sensation of pleasure is a signal indicating that the organism is pursuing the right course of action. The physical sensation of pain is a warning signal of danger, indicating that the organism is pursuing the wrong course of action, that something is impairing the proper function of its body, which requires action to correct it. The best illustration of this can be seen in the rare, freak cases of children who are born without the capacity to experience physical pain; such children do not survive for long; they have no means of discovering what can injure them, no warning signals, and thus a minor cut can develop into a deadly infection, or a major illness can remain undetected until it is too late to fight it.
&#x2013; &ldquo;The Objectivist Ethics&rdquo;, The Virtue of Selfishness, 17
</p>

</div>
<p>
Rand is correct that pain and pleasure are biological motivators.
Pain and pleasure are evolutionarily designed to trigger and provide impetus for sentient organisms to do things that sustain their lives and reproduction.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="orgaa851bc">
<p>
In what manner does a human being discover the concept of &ldquo;value&rdquo;? By what means does he first become aware of the issue of &ldquo;good or evil&rdquo; in its simplest form? By means of the physical sensations of pleasure or pain. Just as sensations are the first step of the development of a human consciousness in the realm of cognition, so they are its first step in the realm of evaluation.
&#x2013; &ldquo;The Objectivist Ethics&rdquo;, The Virtue of Selfishness, 17
</p>

</div>
<p>
Rand didn&rsquo;t make any normative statements in this quote.
Rand is right that people often intuitively learn to associate value with pleasure and/or pain.
She made a good description of how people often discover values.
However, I want to be explicit that I don&rsquo;t believe this value association is rational.
The associations of pleasure with positive value and pain with negative value <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/01/how-i-rejected-hedonism.html">can be rejected with rational justifications</a>.
One reason is that pain is an emotion that is necessary for generating motivation.
Pleasure is a decrease in motivation.
Pleasure isn&rsquo;t always a good thing, since a low state of motivation would make it difficult for humans to do anything in their lives.
I&rsquo;m pointing these things out because I have seen many Objectivists make normative statements about pain and pleasure, and I&rsquo;m arguing that those value judgments are naive.
</p>

<p>
Also, &ldquo;evil&rdquo; implies some sort of intention.
If I accidentally trip, break my leg, and feel of lot of pain, that&rsquo;s not &ldquo;evil&rdquo; because the pain wasn&rsquo;t caused by an agent intending to inflict pain on me.
The pain was inflicted by nature, and nature is not an agent or a conscious subject.
Claiming that &ldquo;nature inflicts pain&rdquo; would anthropomorphize nature.
This is kind of nit-picky, but it would have been more accurate to replace &ldquo;evil&rdquo; with &ldquo;bad&rdquo; in that quote.

Racism is the lowest, most crudely primitive form of collectivism. It is the notion of ascribing moral, social or political significance to a man&rsquo;s genetic lineage—the notion that a man&rsquo;s intellectual and characterological traits are produced and transmitted by his internal body chemistry. Which means, in practice, that a man is to be judged, not by his own character and actions, but by the characters and actions of a collective of ancestors.<br>
Like every form of determinism, racism invalidates the specific attribute which distinguishes man from all other living species: his rational faculty. Racism negates two aspects of man&rsquo;s life: reason and choice, or mind and morality, replacing them with chemical predestination.<br>
A genius is a genius, regardless of the number of morons who belong to the same race—and a moron is a moron, regardless of the number of geniuses who share his racial origin.

All of these statements are correct.

To be clear, there is <i>nothing</i> about race realism that implies that we judge a person based on race instead of their character (assuming that we know their character well enough).

To interpose the threat of physical destruction between a man and his perception of reality, is to negate and paralyze his means of survival; to force him to act against his own judgment, is like forcing him to act against his own sight.

<p>
Rand argues that using &ldquo;force&rdquo; is unethical and irrational because it supposedly takes away a person&rsquo;s ability to reason.
There are multiple problems with this:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>&ldquo;Force&rdquo; is arbitrary and poorly defined (a &ldquo;floating abstraction&rdquo; as Rand would call it), especially if <a href="../civilization/case-against-libertarianism#NAP">it&rsquo;s defined according to the Non-Aggression <del>Principle</del> Spectrum</a>.</li>
<li>A person can still reason even if there&rsquo;s force being exerted against them. People do it everyday. People who pay taxes aren&rsquo;t able to reason any better or any worse than people who don&rsquo;t. Defendants must also use reason to argue for their release when they are held in a courtroom.</li>
<li><a href="https://zerocontradictions.net/epistemology/determinism#agency-is-circumstantial">Agency is circumstantial</a>. Most people have to deal with decisions that are much more &ldquo;forceful&rdquo; than taxation or complying with legal codes, in the sense that they have the agency to pay taxes, and have comparatively far less agency to make tougher decisions between greater conflicting values.</li>
<li>It does not follow that force is unethical or irrational on the basis that it takes away another person&rsquo;s ability to reason. This argument is rationalizing, not a rational argument. In fact, there are many cases where it&rsquo;s rational to prevent or weaken another person(s)&rsquo;s ability to reason <a href="#life-is-violent">if they have conflicting values</a>.</li>

At most, we can define a theory of value and use it to justify itself, hence why <a href="../epistemology/axiology#reproduction-objective-purpose">life and reproduction are intuitively good values</a>.
But that doesn&rsquo;t conclude that life is objectively good.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
We can select a theory of value based on its alignment with biological or psychological value, but there is no prior basis for doing so.
It would be the naturalistic fallacy (leaping across the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem">is | ought gap</a>) to assume that biological or psychological value is philosophical value.
To have a rational theory of value, we must understand that it has no prior basis, and that we choose it.
</p>

<p>
However, that does not mean that we are free to choose any philosophical theory of value and live by it.
Consider the value theory &ldquo;green bottlism&rdquo;, in which making green bottles is intrinsically good, and nothing else has intrinsic value.
You could propose this theory as a joke or a thought experiment, but you could not live by it, because it does not fit your nature.
A philosophical theory that conflicts with human nature could never be adopted.

The instinctive generation of pro-life values by our brains does <i>not</i> provide us with a basis for value, unless we make a conscious choice to an important question, and we recognize that it technically has no rational basis.

Objectivists view Life as a more important value than Reproduction, but Reproduction is actually equally important, if not more important, from a bio-evolutionary and causality perspective.
Without reproduction, life would cease to exist at all.

<blockquote>
<p>
Biological value is objective in the sense that it is an objective property of events.
The oak tree&rsquo;s objective purpose is to reproduce.
Cutting the oak tree down is objectively bad for it.
Biological value is objective, but organism-relative.

<p>
Biological value is not cosmic.
There is no telos to life as a whole.
Life is not instrumental to some higher purpose.
Evolution creates entities with purposes, and each individual organism has its own purpose: to reproduce.

Biological value emerged from causality via the loop of reproduction.
The form of an organism has been selected to reproduce, and every part of an organism has a function that is instrumental to reproduction.

<p>
All of our biological and psychological values (as well as many social values) exist because they made our ancestors more reproductively successful in some way.
In those respects, reproduction is a more fundamental value than life.
Regardless, if you <i>choose</i> to accept <a href="../epistemology/axiology#reproduction-objective-purpose">reproduction</a> (and life) as values, then
you can use those values to justify and affirm each other and themselves.

<p>
There are some objections to address on this important topic.
</p>
<div class="opponent" id="org87566d0">
<p>
We cannot have values unless we&rsquo;re alive to keep and pursue them, so that implies that life is the ultimate value.
</p>

</div>
<p>
Being alive is a requirement for action, but that doesn&rsquo;t make life the highest value.
The Objectivist argument that &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t value anything if you are dead&rdquo; implicitly appeals to a collection of values that life is instrumental towards achieving (e.g. that we should have values at all, we should be alive, <a href="../misc/critiquing-ayn-rands-objectivism#valuing-life-for-happinness"><del>we should be &ldquo;happy&rdquo;</del> we should go through the power process</a>, etc).
Hence, the Objectivist doesn&rsquo;t truly view life as the &ldquo;highest value&rdquo;.
The Objectivist actually views life as a means to an end, even if he is in denial about it.
</p>

<p>
Valuing life (and the values that can be achieved by being alive) also implies valuing a collection of values that are necessary and instrumental for sustaining life.
For example:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We can&rsquo;t act without being alive, therefore life is the fundamental value.</li>
<li>Can&rsquo;t live without eating, therefore eating is the fundamental value.</li>
<li>Can&rsquo;t eat without masticating, therefore masticating is the fundamental value.</li>
<li>Can&rsquo;t masticate for long without brushing your teeth, therefore brushing your teeth is the fundamental value.</li>
</ul>

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The hierarchical structure of values thus goes both ways.
Valuing life (or any value for that matter) implies: 1. a collection of values that are instrumental towards achieving that value (life in this case) <i>and</i> 2. a collection of values that the value in question is instrumental towards.
<a href="../misc/critiquing-ayn-rands-objectivism">And as mentioned earlier</a>, you can value reproduction (and life) so that you can use those values to justify themselves, but only if you <i>choose</i> to accept those values.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-alive-to-act">
<div class="opponent" id="org1743ab8">
<p>
We can make a logical argument that life is the ultimate value, as follows:<br>
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If life is required for values to be achieved, then life is the primary value.<br></li>
<li>Life is required for values to be achieved,<br></li>
</ol>
<p>
Therefore, Life is the primary value (by modus ponens of premises #1 and #2).
</p>

</div>
<p>
This attempt simply repeats the same sentence twice, so it&rsquo;s not a real argument.
Nobody is debating that life is necessary for action (premise #2), but you can&rsquo;t assume the conditional proposition P -&gt; Q (premise #1) unless you <i>first</i> prove that Q logically follows from P.
Since the first premise assumes P -&gt; Q without proving it, it&rsquo;s only begging the question.
</p>

<p>
Also, Life is a consequence of entropy, so we can just as easily make the following argument:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Entropy is required for life.</li>
<li>Life is required for action.</li>
<li>If Entropy is required for action, then entropy is the primary value.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Conclusion: Entropy should be our primary value. We can increase entropy by reproducing more.
</p>

<p>
Note that this chain of reasoning isn&rsquo;t valid either because it assumes premise #3 without first proving its conditional.
This is just another way to show that the Objectivist argument doesn&rsquo;t prove what it wants to prove since <a href="#all-values-are-instrumental">an endless number of instrumental primary values would follow from it</a>.
And just like the first modus ponens argument, <a href="#all-values-are-instrumental">the entropy argument implicitly assumes other values</a>, so it&rsquo;s not a rational argument because it has unquestioned premises.
</p>

<p>
Life is necessary to achieve <i>all</i> values either.
The counter-example is that <a href="#efilism-euvalism-nihilism">if one chooses to value non-existence</a>, then life and reproduction would be vices, not virtues.

Life is worth valuing because humans can achieve happiness (a continuous state of achieving one&rsquo;s values).
Life is inherently valuable because death offers no rewards and negates this possibility.
</p>

</div>
<p>
Life doesn&rsquo;t exist for achieving happiness or for the sake of living.
Life exists to reproduce.
All life on Earth has been naturally selected to reproduce, and no organism would continue to exist if its ancestors didn&rsquo;t reproduce as much as possible.
Biological value emerges out of reproduction.
It is perfectly natural and normal for organisms to die for the sake of reproducing their offspring.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon#Life_cycle">A salmon swims upstream to reproduce and die</a>.
So is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_seal#Breeding_season">elephant seal fighting over a harem</a>.
Or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrodectus#Behaviour">black widow father getting eaten alive by the mother</a>.
Or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitoky">epitokes that die once their gametes have been released into the water</a>.
Or the human who dies in an effort to save his or her children from a terrible accident.
Survival is instrumental to reproduction, not vice versa for the most part.
Reproduction is thus a more rational value than life or survival, if only one of these values could be chosen, especially when viewed from a biological perspective.
The inability of Ayn Rand to have recognized the importance of reproduction in life, biology, and evolutionary is one of the greatest scientific failures in the Objectivist philosophy.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="orgc8f1276">
<p>
When you question your values all the way down, you get &ldquo;I live because I have the potential to live in a good state and achieve my values, and non-existence can&rsquo;t offer me anything compared to that.&rdquo;
</p>

</div>
<p>
This is not true.
If you truly question your values as rigorously as possible, then you realize that there is <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/06/lucifers-question.html">no objective foundation for value</a>.
That is, there are objective reasons to positively value life or non-existence, and no objective reasons to negatively value life or non-existence.
There are intuitive and compelling subjective reasons to positively value life since it fits our evolved instincts, but <a href="../misc/case-against-efilism#argument-for-efilism">there&rsquo;s also compelling and intuitive reasons to value non-existence</a>, especially if one chooses non-existence as a core value within a <a href="../epistemology/axiology#what-are-values">rational theory of value</a>.
</p>

<p>
People are certainly free to value something else besides reproduction (e.g. happiness) since there&rsquo;s no foundation for value, but if they&rsquo;re going to do so, they can&rsquo;t claim to be rational unless they acknowledge that their chosen values are subjective.

<p>
The Objectivist ethics holds man&rsquo;s life as the standard of value—and his own life as the ethical purpose of every individual man.
The difference between &ldquo;standard&rdquo; and &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; in this context is as follows: a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; is an abstract principle that serves as a measurement or gauge to guide a man&rsquo;s choices in the achievement of a concrete, specific purpose. &ldquo;That which is required for the survival of man qua man&rdquo; is an abstract principle that applies to every individual man. The task of applying this principle to a concrete, specific purpose—the purpose of living a life proper to a rational being—belongs to every individual man, and the life he has to live is his own.
Man must choose his actions, values and goals by the standard of that which is proper to man—in order to achieve, maintain, fulfill and enjoy that ultimate value, that end in itself, which is his own life.

<p>
As a counter-example, Efilists value exterminating all the life on Planet Earth, and <a href="../misc/case-against-efilism#argument-for-efilism">they could justify it with reasons that many people would find appealing</a>.
There are no objective reasons why the Efilist&rsquo;s values are &ldquo;better&rdquo; or &ldquo;worse&rdquo; than the Life-Affirmer&rsquo;s values.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="org58aff0e">
<p>
If their end goal is for everyone including themselves to be non-existent, then that is irrational.
</p>

</div>
<p>
Why? Saying that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;irrational&rdquo; to value non-existence appeals to the belief that it&rsquo;s rational to value life.
That appeal is not convincing or persuasive to someone who doesn&rsquo;t value life.
</p>

<p>
Also, there are people who don&rsquo;t necessarily <i>reject</i> life.
Some people (like nihilists) are <i>neutral</i> about whether life continues to exist or not.
</p>

<p>
<a href="../misc/industrial-society-and-its-future-manifesto">Neo-Luddism / Anarcho-Primitivism</a> is another counter-example where technology that would extend life isn&rsquo;t necessarily virtuous since the consequences are perceived to be greater than the benefits.
The goal of Neo-Luddism is to just exist, and go through the <a href="../misc/industrial-society-and-its-future-manifesto#power-process">power process</a>.

<div class="opponent" id="org597301d">
<p>
The fact that people exist who choose to value non-existence doesn&rsquo;t prove that it&rsquo;s rational to value non-existence.
</p>

</div>
<p>
Objectivists have failed to prove that it&rsquo;s rational to value life to people who have chosen <i>not</i> to accept life (or rationality) as a value(s).
At most, <a href="../misc/critiquing-ayn-rands-objectivism#all-values-are-instrumental">Objectivists have only <i>assumed</i> that people should value life</a>.

Why should people value having reasons for or against anything, if they don&rsquo;t value life?
The Efilists, Euvalists, and Nihilists don&rsquo;t care if value ceases to exist once they destroy the Earth and/or achieve non-existence.
It&rsquo;s obvious that they don&rsquo;t care if there are reasons for or against anything, once they stop existing.
That&rsquo;s the whole point.
It&rsquo;s hard for most people to comprehend this because it doesn&rsquo;t fit their intuitions.
Regardless, this is <i>not</i> a logical inconsistency with the Efilist or Euvalist worldviews.

So? Just because a person continues to live, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they have to value life.
It would probably take decades to create a fail-safe plan to create a nuclear bomb that&rsquo;s big enough to destroy the entire Earth.

<p>
Moreover, people need to recognize that it&rsquo;s incredibly difficult to create and execute a successful suicide plan, especially when it&rsquo;s illegal to die by suicide and when life evolved to have many instincts to prevent people from killing themselves.
Objectivists may think that those points imply that it&rsquo;s just more rational to value life, but they don&rsquo;t.
That&rsquo;s because someone can instead conclude that it would be more rational if life doesn&rsquo;t exist at all (i.e. humanity should destroy the Earth).
Due to the <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/01/immanentizing-abyss.html">Abyss</a>, there are no objective reasons, but you can <i>always</i> come up with a subjective reason to justify anything.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-life-as-value-conclusions">
<p>
The bottom line is that <b>there are simply no valid rational arguments to value life, unless you <i>choose</i> to accept life as a value</b>.
To be completely rational, you have to understand that there&rsquo;s no prior basis for valuing what you do, besides that you chose it.
This is part of a more general, overarching philosophical concept called the <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/01/immanentizing-abyss.html">Abyss</a>.
Once you discover and understand the philosophical abyss, real philosophy will begin, and you&rsquo;ll realize that there is no foundation for value.
So just as <b>there are no rational reasons to value life, <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/06/lucifers-question.html">there&rsquo;s also <i>no</i> rational reasons why someone should <i>not</i> value life</a></b>.
Regardless of which option a person chooses (if any), valuing life or non-existence will each imply an overarching framework of values that are necessary to sustain life or necessary to achieve/cope non-existence.
</p>

<p>
If you choose to value rationality and logical consistency, <b>it&rsquo;s <i>not</i> a &ldquo;bad&rdquo; thing to acknowledge that there are no &ldquo;objective&rdquo; reasons to value life</b> unless you choose to view it as being &ldquo;bad&rdquo;.
Again, if you <i>subjectively</i> choose to affirm life as one of your core values, then <a href="#life-can-be-self-affirming">you can use your values of life (and reproduction) to justify themselves</a> as values.
Likewise, <a href="../epistemology/performative-contradictions#reason-empiricism-justification">you can also use rationality to justify itself</a> as well.
I have personally chosen life, reproduction, rationality, and civilization as four of my core values, because I wanted to.
But unlike Objectivists, I am honest in knowing that they aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;objective values&rdquo;.
Objectivists simply can&rsquo;t let go of their assumption in objectivity, so they aren&rsquo;t able to comprehend subjectivity.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-virtue-of-life">
<p>
First, Life doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be a virtue.
<a href="#efilism-euvalism-nihilism">There are several counter-examples for demonstrating this</a>.
<a href="../misc/critiquing-ayn-rands-objectivism#life-is-not-ultimate-value">Nor is life the &ldquo;ultimate virtue&rdquo;</a> if a subject chooses to affirm it.
There is no objective foundation for value, so there&rsquo;s no reason why values aligned with Efilism, Eulavism, Nihilism, Neo-Luddism, or some other worldview should be deemed as inherently anti-virtuous.
</p>

<p>
I agree with Objectivism that people should strive to have rational values, and that values are things that one acts to gain and/or keep.
I have personally chosen to affirm life, but <a href="../misc/critiquing-ayn-rands-objectivism#life-is-not-ultimate-value">it doesn&rsquo;t follow that life is the ultimate value</a>.
Objectivism also affirms life as a core value, but the difference is that Objectivism claims that life is an objective value, whereas I recognize it as a subjective value, according to <a href="#subject-object-dichotomy">how I defined &ldquo;objective&rdquo; and &ldquo;subjective&rdquo;</a>.
Objective values don&rsquo;t exist.
While life is <i>not</i> an objective value, I am in favor of living on Earth, having children, and creating a long-term prosperous (and selfish) society.
</p>

<p>
My core values are rationality, reproduction, and civilization.
Humans are biological organisms, so they can and should be viewed from a completely biological point of view.
Objectivism doesn&rsquo;t explicitly value reproduction, but the fact is that <a href="#valuing-life-for-happinness">if life wasn&rsquo;t designed to reproduce, then life wouldn&rsquo;t exist</a> today.
All life <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPXJ85W7">evolves to reproduce as many offspring as possible</a>.
If we dedicate our lives primarily towards anything besides our <a href="../epistemology/axiology#reproduction-objective-purpose">objective purpose</a>, then our subjective purpose is not aligned with our objective purpose in life, i.e. we would be doing things that we&rsquo;re not designed to do.
I&rsquo;m not saying that that&rsquo;s necessarily bad.
It just doesn&rsquo;t align with <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/04/toward-rational-humanism.html">my chosen values</a>.
</p>

<p>
Objectivism also believes the goal of life should be the &ldquo;pursuit of happiness&rdquo;, but this is a pointless endeavor, if <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/02/motivation.html">happiness is defined with a hedonistic connotation</a>.
Zero Sum Emotions Theory (ZSE Theory) <a href="https://brittonicmemetics.wordpress.com/2023/07/28/uninducible-knowledge/">implies that pleasure and pain balance out</a>.
Hence, Long-term happiness is not possible, so this shouldn&rsquo;t be the primary goal of life.

People can and should lie to a criminal or an abusive government if it will lessen the harm that the perpetrator does.
It is also true that lying in most other situations will require that the individual must avoid getting caught and punished.
I agree that lying can cause a person to lose their independence in the sense that they become dependent on other finding out about their lies, but there&rsquo;s no reason why a person shouldn&rsquo;t lie if lying will benefit them <i>and</i> they can get away with it without any negative consequences.

Perhaps a liar or a thief would feel guilt and would be unable to go through the power process of obtaining items/money via their own labor, but there&rsquo;s no reason why they should feel that way if they understand that there&rsquo;s no foundation for value or morality.

In actuality, they have it backwards.
The Objectivists are the ones who are trying to hide game-theoretical arguments inside moral arguments.
A perfect example is how they point out that thieves face the dilemma of getting caught or having the owners retaliate against them for trying to steal their property.
That&rsquo;s a game-theoretical argument against theft, not a moral one.
Despite this, they still don&rsquo;t present a complete explanation of how game theory applies to society and such.

If every single person was doing what they absolutely love in life, then the world economy would <i>not</i> continue to function properly.
A better and most realistic way to think about life, careers, and relationships is like fishing.
The people who say that &ldquo;people should follow their passions&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;people should do what they love&rdquo; are already passionate about doing what they do, so their advice sets an impossible high bar for everyone else.
Some spots are beautiful to you and will help you catch fish, but other spots won&rsquo;t, but you can&rsquo;t know where you would like to spend time until you go there and you can&rsquo;t know how many fish you will catch there until you try.
The younger you are, the more time you can spend sailing to different spots and the older you are, the more time you get to spend in places you know you like, refining your abilities to catch fish there.

<div class="opponent" id="org4345da2">
<p>
If physical force is to be barred from social relationships, men need an institution charged with the task of protecting their rights under an objective code of rules.<br>
This is the task of a government—of a proper government—its basic task, its only moral justification and the reason why men do need a government.<br>
A government is the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control—i.e., under objectively defined laws.
&#x2013; &ldquo;The Nature of Government&rdquo;, The Virtue of Selfishness, 109
</p>

</div>
<p>
This quote projects moral bias onto what it thinks governments should be, instead of describing what they actually are and what they do.
It&rsquo;s more productive to think about government in terms of game-theory, <a href="#objective-morality-nonsense">since there is no objective basis for morality</a>.
The correct goal of government is to resolve <a href="../civilization/political-philosophy#PDs">Prisoner Dilemmas</a> and Tragedies of the Commons.
Government comes from the necessity to create a reasonable set of laws that would create a societal framework from which selfish individuals can cooperate together for greater mutual gain (than if they didn&rsquo;t cooperate together).
Cooperation is the foundation of civilization, and the best legal code is the one that enables that to the greatest extent possible.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s not possible to create &ldquo;objectively defined laws&rdquo; because every set of laws would benefit one person or another more than everyone else.
Every human is selfish, so from a game-theoretic perspective, every human would prefer a set of laws that is tailored to suit their needs the best, even if it comes at the cost of others.
However, for a functional and ideal society that has a high average amount of prosperity and wealth for everybody, an ideal set of laws would treat everybody equally and enable the highest levels of cooperation between individuals as possible.
This is a compromise that everybody must make to achieve outcomes where everybody is collectively better off.

The source of the government&rsquo;s authority is &ldquo;the consent of the governed.&rdquo; This means that the government is not the ruler, but the servant or agent of the citizens; it means that the government as such has no rights except the rights delegated to it by the citizens for a specific purpose.
&#x2013; &ldquo;The Nature of Government&rdquo;, The Virtue of Selfishness, 110
</p>

</div>
<p>
The true source of a government&rsquo;s authority is its <i>power</i>.
It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether most of the people consent to the government&rsquo;s authority or not.
If the government has the power and the will to continue enforcing authority on its people, then it will continue to have authority.
Since governments have to resolve game-theoretic conflicts, it&rsquo;s also not possible for a government to have the consent of <i>every</i> person that it governs.

The source of man&rsquo;s rights is not divine law or congressional law, but the law of identity. A is A—and Man is Man. Rights are conditions of existence required by man&rsquo;s nature for his proper survival. If man is to live on earth, it is right for him to use his mind, it is right to act on his own free judgment, it is right to work for his values and to keep the product of his work. If life on earth is his purpose, he has a right to live as a rational being: nature forbids him the irrational. Any group, any gang, any nation that attempts to negate man&rsquo;s rights, is wrong, which means: is evil, which means: is anti-life.
&#x2013; Galt&rsquo;s Speech, For the New Intellectual, 182
</p>

</div>
<p>
It&rsquo;s not &ldquo;evil&rdquo; to attack people since <a href="#life-is-violent">life is a struggle for scarce resources</a>.
Rights exist to solve the game-theoretic problems that arise due to the nature of life.
In the absence of a law enforcement that would punish people for committing crimes, every person has an incentive to kill, abuse, and steal from other people because these actions make it easier to gain the resources for supporting oneself and one&rsquo;s desires, compared to if they had labored and traded with other people instead.
Laws against theft, murder, rape, etc prevent these game-theoretic problems from arising, thus leading to collectively better outcomes for a functioning society.

There&rsquo;s no such thing as collective entities. There&rsquo;s only individuals.
</p>

</div>
<p>
No one is claiming that collectives are not composed of individuals.
But you can&rsquo;t think of collective entities as <i>isolated</i> individuals (e.g. the United States government, Ford Motors, the Free Software Foundation, etc).
Collectives exist as a mental concept because it&rsquo;s useful to think of them that way.
We don&rsquo;t achieve anything by denying that we can think of them as concepts.
The United States government, Ford Motors, the Free Software Foundation, etc are not single individuals.
They could never function as the work of only a single person.
Collective entities are defined as individuals who work together in specialized roles within a power structure to create a functional system that dedicates itself towards a goal.

&ldquo;Collective Values&rdquo; benefit majorities by oppressing minorities. They are a dangerous concept.
</p>

</div>
<p>
The existence of minorities does not cause collective entities to break down as a concept.
As mentioned, all collective entities consist of a <i>power structure</i>, so it is implied that most people in the collective do not have equal power (in most cases) to get <i>exactly</i> what they want (which would be world-domination for most people, because <a href="#life-is-violent">life is selfish</a>).
Minorities can be harmed by collective interests, but that&rsquo;s just part of nature <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html">(1)</a>, <a href="https://expandingrationality.substack.com/p/circles-of-order-and-chaos">(2)</a>, <a href="https://expandingrationality.substack.com/p/the-modern-problems-with-conformity">(3)</a>, <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/07/circles-of-control-and-freedom.html">(4)</a>.
If a collective entity should never override the desires of a minority, then laws against theft, murder, rape, etc shouldn&rsquo;t exist either because they override the desires of criminals.
People can opt out of society any time they&rsquo;d like, but as soon as they do so, they become an outsider.

As established in other sections of this essay, successful societies have to resolve game-theoretic problems using government policies.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-net-negative-to-civilization">
<p>
<a href="http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/anarchism.html">Although Rand was a harsh critic of Anarchism</a>, many of her followers are Anarcho-Capitalists since Objectivist Ethics are a gateway into believing in Anarcho-Capitalism.
Anarcho-Capitalists are just as ignorant about human nature as Communists are, and their political ideology is equally dangerous to Modern Civilization.
Many of them will be reading this critique, so this has to be addressed.
</p>

<p>
The Anarcho-Objectivists are a case of <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/07/status-pyramid-schemes.html">purity spiraling among the Objectivist community</a>.
For that reason, Objectivism is a net-negative to civilization because Ancaps are more opposed to Georgism than literally every other political ideology out there.
They are thus <a href="../civilization/georgism-crash-course">the greatest opponents to solving the greatest economic problems that are facing the modern world</a>.
So although Objectivism advocates for a pro-free-market philosophy, it ironically (albeit indirectly) promotes an extremely anti-free market philosophy since <a href="../civilization/case-against-libertarianism#free-markets-circular-reasoning">it&rsquo;s not possible to have free markets at all without a government to establish them</a>, nor is it possible to have <a href="#equal-negative-land-rights">free markets without equal negative land rights for everybody</a>.

<p>
Setting Anarcho-Objectivism aside, even standard Objectivism still promotes ideas that are harmful to the preservation of modern civilization due to its obsession with individualist libertarian morals.
<a href="../faqs/race">Racial denialism</a>, opposition to eugenics, and free-range immigration policies will increase the proliferation of dysgenics in modern society, <a href="../faqs/overpopulation">cornucopian delusions</a> will increase the risk of civilization collapsing due overpopulation in the long run, and an <a href="../civilization/technology">overly optimistic and one-sided view of technology</a> will distract humanity from addressing the problems created by the evolutionary mismatch in our world.

<p>
<a href="#valid-conclusions">Objectivism is better than most other philosophies</a>, but it still makes the same mistakes that most philosophies make: it neglects the implications of the subject | object dichotomy, and it has strong moral biases.
These interfere with its ability to understand human nature and the implications for how a prosperous human society should be organized.
Humanity is best understood by understanding the implications of evolution, biology, and game-theory.
</p>

<p>
Once again, I very strongly emphasize that this essay has <i>not</i> refuted all the problems with Objectivism <i>by itself</i>.
Due to the breadth and depth of the Objectivist philosophy, a full and proper refutation of Objectivism that explains each of the arguments in sufficient depth requires reading and understanding all or most of the linked essays on this webpage.
</p>

<p>
If anybody thinks that I have misrepresented Objectivism, I encourage them to explain to me how and why.
If anybody disagrees with the conclusions made in this essay, I challenge them to read the linked essays, question their beliefs, and explain how the essay is wrong if they still don&rsquo;t agree.
