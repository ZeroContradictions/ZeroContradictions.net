<h2 id="intro"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
A stubborn fool tried to persuade me to switch to the carnivore fad diet by sending sent me some videos to watch by a quack doctor named Anthony Chaffee.
Although I was skeptical of the videos, I watched them anyway and I wrote this rebuttal essay in response.
Some of the videos brought up interesting topics, but I see them more as examples of how easy it is for <a href="../epistemology/difficult-to-change-minds">belief networks to use intuition for forming coherence</a>, while rejecting scientific consensuses.
For the most part, the videos were a waste of time, aside from the research that I did afterwards to evaluate their claims.
</p>

<p>
Carnivore diet proponents tend to rely on pseudoscience and anecdotes to support their claims, but I don&rsquo;t care about anecdotes.
Anybody can say this anecdote or that anecdote to support whatever they <i>want</i> to believe.
I only care about statistics.
The <i>only thing</i> that anyone could say to convince me to try the carnivore fad diet is if they had a larger body of statistics proving that carnivores live longer than people who eat Mediterranean or plant-based diets, contrary to the current consensus in nutritional science.
</p>


<p>
Except for maybe Inuits, Mongolians, and other races who have long histories of carnism, the carnivore diet is a terrible diet for most humans.
The keto diet is also good for some people who have epilepsy, but they have a medical condition, and are thus not like most people.

<h3 id="nutrients"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Nutrients</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-nutrients">
<p>
It&rsquo;s not true that humans can get all of their nutrients from eating meat (or at least the kind that most people think of) (e.g. Vitamin C, flavonoids, <a href="#fiber-is-necessary">dietary fiber</a>, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-nutrients-you-cant-get-from-animal-foods">et cetera</a>).
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit_cuisine">Innuit diet</a> is ~99% meat, but it should <i>not</i> be mistaken as being the same as the carnivore diet.
The Innuit are able to get all the nutrients they need because they eat <i>all</i> the organs of the animals that they capture, not just the muscles.
Since many animal organs aren&rsquo;t present in most grocery stores and supermarkets, it&rsquo;s not possible for most people to only eat meat <i>and</i> get all the nutrients they need.
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1096719220300329">The Inuits also have a mutation that prevents them from going into ketosis</a>, so they won&rsquo;t die when they are unable to find food.
Most humans don&rsquo;t have that gene.
</p>

<p>
From what I&rsquo;ve seen, the proponents of the carnivore diet don&rsquo;t focus too much on how eating meat can enable us to get <i>all</i> the nutrition that we need.
Yes, they may point out specific nutrients that are abundant in meat and the benefits of those nutrients (e.g. Zinc, DHA, Vitamin B12, Iron, Vitamin B6, etc), but any proponent for any fad diet could do that too
(e.g. the corporatocracy-backed 3-cup-of-dairy-a-day advertising gimmick that repeated &ldquo;dairy products contain calcium&rdquo; to get people to buy more dairy products).
What&rsquo;s really important is how we ensure that we can get <i>all</i> the nutrients that we need, not just point to a select handful, at the expense of ignoring others.
Furthermore, a healthy diet should be able to identify which foods one would need to eat <i>specifically</i> to acquire each of the nutrients necessary for being healthy.
</p>

<p>
Eating red meat likely correlates with a greater risk of colon cancer and gout, but further research will be needed to confirm this.
The healthiest meats / animal products to consume are poultry, fish, seafood, and eggs.
</p>

<p>
Excluding entire food groups (i.e. fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains, fiber, etc) is also socially restrictive, and likely to prevent humans from gaining all the nutrition that they need.
It&rsquo;s ridiculous that carnivore proponents claim that the vegan diet is &ldquo;socially restrictive&rdquo; when there are carnivore influencers like Meatrition who promote avoiding <i>all</i> the aforementioned foods.
Carnivore proponents also tend to be against seed oils, but this opposition is irrational. See:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qInpEKHdjXk">Are Seed Oils Causing the Diseases of Civilization? Episode 1 - Viva Longevity</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Qk2LEN6opQ">Are Seed Oils Causing the Diseases of Civilization? Episode 2: Your Questions Answered - Viva Longevity</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The evidence in demonstrating any health benefits for the carnivore diet is lacking.
By comparison, the Mediterranean Diet has been used for thousands of years, and has consistently correlated which good health and low rates of disease throughout all that time.

<h3 id="anecdotal-claims"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Anecdotal Claims</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-anecdotal-claims">
<div class="opponent" id="org97edc25">
<p>
A growing number of people with &ldquo;untreatable&rdquo; diseases resolved them with the carnivore diet.
</p>

</div>

<p>
Some points:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Those are purely anecdotal claims, and many of them are exaggerations.</li>
<li>An estimated half of the anecdotes are made-up, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1p7kmbn/i_was_paid_to_discredit_veganism_online_ama/">astroturfed stories created by the meat industry</a>.</li>
<li>Just as many leave the carnivore diet as there are people who join it.
Just from 2025 alone, three major carnivore influencers who left the diet include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_King">The Liver King</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzYd2Zf9Gn8">Robert Kiltz</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/uq-6DiTR3x8">CarnivoreJT</a>, and <a href="https://zerocontradictions.net/images/mikhaila-peterson-quitting-carnivore-diet.jpg">Mikhaila Peterson</a>.
There&rsquo;s plenty more, and from many other years.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a growing number of people who are <i>getting diseases</i> from the carnivore diet.</li>
<li>Those same people almost certainly could&rsquo;ve fixed their problems just as well (and probably better) by following a Mediterranean-like diet instead.
If not, then many of them probably had an unknown health condition that was causing their problems.</li>
<li>The keto diet can prevent epilepsy in some children, but it doesn&rsquo;t follow that everybody should go keto.
Smoking medical marijuana has also successfully prevented epilepsy in some people where every other option that they tried failed.
But it doesn&rsquo;t follow that <i>everybody</i> should smoke marijuana.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Furthermore, I don&rsquo;t believe that most of the carnivore influencers truly adhere to their claimed diet everyday.
For example, Shawn Baker&rsquo;s followers once spotted some apples and bananas in his kitchen once.
It&rsquo;s highly unlikely that any true carnivore could sustain the diet for long without experiencing eventual health problems.
</p>

<p>
Mikhaila Peterson is/was cited by almost every keto/carnivore diet influencer as &rsquo;proof&rsquo; of the carnivore diet&rsquo;s supposed health benefits.
On 2025 September 15, Peterson announced that she started a nasal spray which treated a sinus infection and mold illness that she had.
After her treatment, <a href="../images/mikhaila-peterson-quitting-carnivore-diet.jpg">she was able to start eating plant-based foods again</a>.
The implication is that while the carnivore diet offered a short-term remedy to her condition, there was a better way to resolve it that did not require her to sacrifice her long-term health.
I suspect that a similar case applies to many other anecdotal claims in favor of the carnivore diet.

<p>
You have to stay on the carnivore diet for months before your body and microbiome adapt.
</p>

</div>
<p>
It&rsquo;s more likely that the carnivores insist that people just have to wait and adapt before the diet starts working because it doesn&rsquo;t actually work.
Every time it doesn&rsquo;t work, they can just gaslight people by saying that they just haven&rsquo;t stayed on the diet long enough for the effects to start kicking in.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, I didn&rsquo;t need to adapt to a whole food plant based (WFPB) diet once I switched and stopped my old processed foods diet.
The WFPB diet had immediately positive results for me.

<div id="outline-container-saturated-fat" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="saturated-fat"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Saturated Fat</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-saturated-fat">
<p>
Excluding carbs from one&rsquo;s diet typically requires increasing intake of protein and fat (saturated or unsaturated) in order for someone to get enough calories each day.
Since carnivores typically consume more saturated fat and excess sodium, both of these factors <i>increase</i> the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
</p>

<p>
Humans who lived a meat-heavy hunter gatherer lifestyle had more exercise than humans who lived an agricultural lifestyle.
This would&rsquo;ve compensated for the negative effects of eating the high amount of saturated fat in meat by countering harmful LDL chloresterol levels.
<a href="#longevity">Low-carb diets are also associated with shorter lifespans</a>, especially if they&rsquo;re done for long terms and the dieter is already at a healthy weight.
</p>

<p>
The carnivores have absolutely no evidence that increasing one&rsquo;s intake of saturated fat will lead to health benefits.
Many of the influencers <i>know</i> this, but they pretend that saturated fat won&rsquo;t clog people&rsquo;s arteries anyway.
Consider how <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fd83rd5sb0ssb1.jpg">Amber O&rsquo;Hearn (a carnivore influencer) repeatedly evaded questions about saturated fat</a> instead of answering them.

<div id="outline-container-weight-loss" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="weight-loss"><span class="section-number-3">2.4.</span> Weight Loss</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-weight-loss">
<p>
Eating a low-carb diet can help people lose weight.
Carbs are a basic nutrient your body turns into glucose, or blood sugar, to make energy for your body to work. A low-carb diet, like keto and the early phase of the Atkins Diet, triggers your body into nutritional ketosis.
Your liver starts to make ketones &#x2013; a fuel that kicks in when your body doesn&rsquo;t have enough sugar to run on &#x2013; by breaking down fat.
To bring about nutritional ketosis, extreme low-carb diets cap your carb intake at less than 10% of your total macronutrient (carbs, fat, and protein) intake.
That translates to 20 to 50 grams a day of carbs.
Low-carb diets generally shoot for under 26% of nutrition intake, or 130 grams.
</p>

<p>
Low-carb diets also tend to be much higher in protein than low-fat diets.
Protein can reduce appetite, boost metabolism and help people hold on to muscle mass despite restricting calories.
</p>

<p>
The general key to losing weight is to burn more calories than one takes in.
It&rsquo;s that simple.
Theoretically, any diet could encourage weight loss as long as caloric intake stays low while the subject gets plenty of exercise.
But there are reasons why a carnivore diet may be more effective for weight loss.
The high-protein content of the diet may be responsible for most of the carnivore diet&rsquo;s health effects.
Even then, plant proteins are more preferable to animal proteins for reducing the risk of cancer.

<div id="outline-container-fiber-is-necessary" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="fiber-is-necessary"><span class="section-number-3">2.5.</span> Why Fiber Is Necessary For Human Diets</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-fiber-is-necessary">
<p>
The idea that fiber isn&rsquo;t necessary for healthy diets is a misunderstanding of the fact that &ldquo;Humans can&rsquo;t gain nutrients from fiber&rdquo;.
</p>
<div class="opponent" id="org2aaa516">
<p>
Carnivores don&rsquo;t eat plants, so they don&rsquo;t get fiber.
</p>

</div>
<p>
Correct. Instead, carnivores eat bones, feathers, and fur along with the meat they consume, which basically serves the exact same function as fiber.
Now obviously, humans should not be eating bones (specifically cooked bones), feathers, or fur, so humans still need a way to get the benefits of fiber if they try the carnivore diet.
</p>

<p>
If your goal is to just live, then yes, humans don&rsquo;t need fiber.
However, avoiding fiber in the long-term will negatively affect anyone&rsquo;s health and lead to disease.
Low fiber can make you constipated and increase chances of certain cancers, heart disease, diabetes, etc.
</p>

<p>
If your goal is to live well and long, then fiber is essential, as it provides healthy digestion and healthy gut microbiota, which is essential to overall good health.
Those good gut bacteria produce valuable post-biotics that can help with regulating immune function, fixing leaky gut, and fighting chronic inflammation.
Fiber also slows digestion, which helps with satiety.
This can help people eat less and in turn keep a healthy body weight, which will improve overall health.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="org83e0170">
<p>
Fiber is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinutrient">antinutrient</a> because it prevents people from absorbing nutrients.
</p>

</div>
<p>
It&rsquo;s true that the body does not absorb nutrients from fiber directly, but it is critical for your microbiome.
The best predictor of a healthy microbiome is to have a diet with a highly diverse set of plants because it provides a diverse set of fiber for our gut.
Our microbiome is critical because it regulates our immune system, levels of inflammation, anxiety, and other critical attributes of health.
</p>


<div class="opponent" id="org3443090">
<p>
Low fiber is recommended to help cancer patients to relax their gut and have it do less work.
If fiber is recommended against in a harm-state scenario, then that implies that it&rsquo;s a bad thing.
</p>

</div>
<p>
There are no logical requirements that necessitate that conclusion from the premises.
There are also some foods that are not recommended for pregnant women, people with epilepsy, etc that can be beneficial in other scenarios.
So, it doesn&rsquo;t imply anything when some foods are recommended against in strained or dire bodily states.
Even alcohol can be beneficial for some demographics, even when it has neutral or harmful effects for most people:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
So who might benefit from a daily alcoholic drink?
Alcohol offers little benefit and potential risks for a pregnant woman and her unborn child, a recovering alcoholic, a person with liver disease, and individuals taking one or more medications that interact with alcohol.
It doesn&rsquo;t benefit younger men and women, because their risk of heart disease is low and it isn&rsquo;t possible to bank the benefits for the future.
For a sixty-year-old man with high cholesterol whose father died of a heart attack at age sixty-one, a drink a day could offer some protection against heart disease that is likely to outweigh potential harm (assuming he isn&rsquo;t prone to alcoholism).
&#x2013; Walter Willett, <i><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5579.Eat_Drink_and_Be_Healthy">Eat Drink And Be Healthy</a></i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Fiber also makes people feel satiated for longer periods of time, which help prevents overeating and eases weight management.
It also aids the digestion of other nutrients.

<div id="outline-container-olympic-athletes" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="olympic-athletes"><span class="section-number-3">2.6.</span> Olympic Athletes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-olympic-athletes">
<p>
If the carnivore diet was really the best diet for athletic performance, then all the Olympic athletes would use it.
But there&rsquo;s still not a single known Olympic athlete who uses or endorses the carnivore diet.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="orgab54ba0">
<p>
But there are carnivore Olympic athletes.
Most Olympians just won&rsquo;t admit it because there&rsquo;s a huge stigma against admitting to and promoting the carnivore diet.
</p>

</div>
<p>
If there&rsquo;s a stigma against the carnivore diet despite it supposedly being the best diet, then why not try to break the stigma?
If many Olympic athletes really do use the carnivore diet, then why would so many of them and their performance nutritionists choose to collectively lie about it?
Wouldn&rsquo;t the simpler explanation be that the carnivore diet simply isn&rsquo;t optimal for athletic performance?
</p>

<p>
And if there&rsquo;s a stigma against the carnivore diet, then the simpler explanation would be that the carnivore diet is unhealthy (for most people and most cases).
Occam&rsquo;s Razor FTW.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="org65a6b97">
<p>
Athletes make money by endorsing non-carnivore products, so they won&rsquo;t admit to being carnivores.
</p>

</div>
<p>
If Olympic athletes make money from endorsing non-carnivore products, then we need to ask: Why would Olympic athletes lie to millions of people about what they actually eat?
Wouldn&rsquo;t they rather live in a world where most people make healthy lifestyle choices?
There are also consequences to lying when other people find out.
There are no good reasons to suspect that their performance nutritionists are lying about what they advise their Olympic clients.
</p>

<div class="opponent" id="orgaf3d6f3">
<p>
It wouldn&rsquo;t make sense for Olympic athletes to promote what they&rsquo;re eating, since their competitors may catch on and use it against them.
</p>

</div>
<p>
Olympic athletes are among the best in the world, they all have a better understanding of nutrition than the average person, and they often have professional performance nutritionists who advise their diets.
Some random Olympian lying about his/her diet is unlikely to convince other Olympians to try it.
</p>

<p>
All in all, there is no evidence that any Olympian has ever used the carnivore diet.
It&rsquo;s just a myth.
To perform at a truly high level in virtually any athletic endeavor, you need large amounts of <i>both</i> protein and carbs.
You can get large amounts of protein from plants, but you can&rsquo;t get large amounts of carbs from eating meat.
Hence why there are several vegan and vegetarian Olympic athletes (not to say that I endorse veganism), but zero carnivore Olympians.
</p>

<hr>
<div class="opponent" id="org4d347c5">
<p>
What&rsquo;s wrong with the pro-carnivore-diet claim that humans don&rsquo;t need to eat carbohydrates since their bodies can do gluconeogenesis instead?
</p>

</div>
<p>
The pro-carnivore diet claim about gluconeogenesis overlooks several important physiological realities:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Metabolic inefficiency: While your body can indeed create glucose from non-carbohydrate sources through gluconeogenesis, this process is metabolically costly and less efficient than directly consuming carbohydrates.
It requires additional energy expenditure to convert proteins and fats into glucose.</li>
<li>Protein requirements: Relying exclusively on gluconeogenesis means your body must break down either dietary protein or your own muscle tissue to create glucose.
This increases overall protein requirements beyond what&rsquo;s needed for normal tissue maintenance and growth.</li>
<li>Brain function: Although the brain can partially adapt to using ketones for energy during carbohydrate restriction, it still requires some glucose.
The brain consumes roughly 120g of glucose daily in a typical adult, placing significant demands on gluconeogenesis in a zero-carb diet.</li>
<li>Physiological stress: Chronic gluconeogenesis can increase cortisol levels and potentially create hormonal imbalances due to the metabolic stress of constant glucose production.</li>
<li>Evolutionary context: While our ancestors could survive periods without carbohydrates, most traditional hunter-gatherer societies consumed mixed diets including plant foods when available, suggesting our biology evolved with at least some carbohydrate intake.</li>
<li>Individual variation: Some people adapt better to very low carbohydrate diets than others due to genetic factors and metabolic differences.</li>
</ol>
<p>
While gluconeogenesis is a remarkable adaptive mechanism that allows humans to survive without dietary carbohydrates, relying on it exclusively as a long-term strategy may not be optimal for most people&rsquo;s health and metabolic function.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-cherry-picked-plant-toxicity">
<p>
I wrote this list of bullets in a response to Anthony Chaffee&rsquo;s video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1cqNDDG4aA"><i>Plants are trying to kill you</i></a>, which promotes the supposed benefits of the carnivore diet and the so-called &ldquo;Modern Toxin Theory of Disease&rdquo;.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All the examples of toxicity in plant-based foods were obviously cherry-picked.
It&rsquo;s true that many plants have lots of toxins, but we should just be careful about what chemicals get placed in our food in general.
For example, there are concerns over talcum powder and overly high doses of fluoride in foods, along with other chemicals whose names are too complicated for most people to remember.</li>
<li>Given that some plants rely on animals to disperse their seeds, there are many plants for which it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to carry toxins.</li>
<li>Even if inedible plants have lots of toxins in them, this shouldn&rsquo;t matter much because humans tend to eat edible plants, not inedible plants.
Humans have also been selectively breeding crops and such for literally thousands of years.
Especially with GMOs nowadays, it&rsquo;s hard to believe that toxins would still be as abundant in our food as Chaffee claims.
Furthermore, most of the plant foods that I eat don&rsquo;t have toxins in them, otherwise I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to eat them.</li>
<li>Once we&rsquo;ve established that a plant food is free of toxins or that we can eat it without being affected by the toxins, the next question to ask if: Do the plant foods meet our nutrition needs?
And the answer is yes, as long as we eat a variety of them within a balanced diet.</li>
<li>Chaffee pointed out that most mushrooms / fungi are toxic, and he&rsquo;s right.
But fungi are technically not plants.
They are a completely different taxonomical kingdom within the tree of life.</li>
<li>What is the exact source for the claim that Brussels sprouts have 130 toxins?
I couldn&rsquo;t find or identify it around 29:45.</li>
<li>I couldn&rsquo;t find any information on the &ldquo;Modern Toxin Theory of Disease&rdquo; either.
Maybe it&rsquo;s a new theory, but in any case, it&rsquo;s more likely that the research supporting the theory is meant to be provocative, not honest.
Otherwise, the MTTD would be supported by the scientific consensus and would&rsquo;ve been proposed decades ago.
It didn&rsquo;t take too long for people to figure out that cigarettes and tobacco are toxic and carcinogenic.
Besides veganism (which isn&rsquo;t mainstream), there&rsquo;s no moral dogma to prevent the MTTD from becoming popular, so we can rule out the possibility that moral beliefs are suppressing the MTTD.</li>
<li>The sources cited at 29:45 are certainly cherry-picked.
Anybody could cherry-pick sources to support whatever claim they want, hence consensuses and rationality are needed to determine the truth.</li>
<li>Chaffee claimed that vegetable oils are associated with increased cardiovascular risk, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qInpEKHdjXk">that&rsquo;s not true at all</a>.
Vegetable oils have unsaturated fat (the healthy type of fat that people should consume more of), and there&rsquo;s no health risks to eating unsaturated fat.
The scientific consensus does not support this claim.
This is <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Cholesterol_denialism">cholesterol denialism</a>.</li>
<li>When Chaffee debated Dr. Matthew Nagra, Chaffee claimed that his video title &ldquo;Plants Are Trying To Kill You&rdquo; was an exaggeration and that he didn&rsquo;t really believe that, but that&rsquo;s not what he said in the video.
I never expected quack doctors to make consistent or truthful claims anyway.</li>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16hsBPtHSJY">Chris MacAskil of Viva Longevity has also made a response video to Chaffee&rsquo;s viral video</a>.
He makes some good points in the video which aren&rsquo;t addressed above, but there&rsquo;s lots of things that he didn&rsquo;t cover.

<p>
This section is a response to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-WUb3mJEso&amp;list=PLkkRSboRx_u2ymm3qL2PvUiwSa8KWvmk7&amp;index=7">Why We Are Carnivores Slide Presentation</a> by Anthony Chaffee.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The real reason why human teeth shrunk is not because they ate meat that were softer than plants, but rather because humans evolved to cook their food before eating it.
Thus, humans no longer needed teeth for breaking down so much of their food.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s possible that a decrease in nutrition may have caused height to decrease after the agricultural revolution.
But we also have to keep in mind that humans in the past had to live by eating what they could hunt, gather, and find <i>locally</i>.
There were no guarantees that humans could always get <i>all</i> the nutrition that they need.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Another plausible explanation for the decrease in height during the agricultural revolution is that shorter heights made it easier to harvest grains and other crops, not poor nutrition.</li>
<li>For example, it was necessary for East Asians to evolve smaller statures to make it easier to farm rice.
They evolved so that they are naturally shorter, even when they have no nutrient deficiencies.</li>
<li>Being taller isn&rsquo;t necessarily healthier, even if it&rsquo;s associated with social prestige and desirability.
Shorter people tend to live longer lives and have fewer diseases due to the square-cube law.</li>
<li>Being shorter would only be an undeniable bad thing if the people were shorter due to being malnourished, rather than due to natural selection.</li>
<li>One of the main reasons why the Masai are so tall and slender is because it makes it easy for their bodies to dissipate heat, especially when they live near the equator.</li>
<li>It makes sense that a taller height could confer an evolutionary advantage for hunter and gatherers, and humans who had to fight frequent wars with other humans just to survive and protect themselves.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It&rsquo;s more interesting how brain volumes slightly decreased during the post agricultural revolution.
The reasons aren&rsquo;t fully understood. Regardless, I don&rsquo;t see how this is necessarily a bad thing.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Modern humans today and in the last few thousand years are smarter than humans from 10,000+ years ago, while eating as many plants as they do and having smaller brain volumes.</li>
<li>It could be that human brains evolved for smaller volumes, as part of increased efficiency.</li>
<li>Bird brains have twice the neural density of mammalian brains, which helps explain why some birds can be so intelligent, despite having brains with such small volumes.
What matters is intelligence, not brain volume.</li>
<li>While brain sizes sharply went down when agriculture became the dominant source of food, it was a small drop in size, compared to the massive amount of brain growth that occurred during the Ice Age and prior.</li>
<li>We should also keep in mind that <a href="../faqs/race#intelligence-tradeoffs">intelligence isn&rsquo;t advantageous in all environments</a>.
Maybe a slightly less intelligent brain was more adaptive for agriculture-dominant environments.
If that&rsquo;s necessary for survival in an environment that has reached its carrying capacity, then that&rsquo;s okay.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It used to be important for humans to eat a sufficient amount of meat to be intelligent, but it&rsquo;s no longer the primary factor regarding intelligence in the modern world.</li>
<li><a href="../faqs/race#american-indian-agriculture">The American Indians had agriculture too</a>.
It&rsquo;s not true that American Indians had completely carnivorous diets prior to Manifest Destiny.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>And even if they did have a heavily carnivorous diet, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they were smarter than the Europeans who visited them, like Chaffee had claimed.
Maybe they were said to have a big heads, which are associated with bigger brains and thus higher intelligence, but if that&rsquo;s true, then why are American Indians one of the least intelligent races today?</li>
<li>A more plausible explanation for why Native Americans were among the tallest races in the world during the 1800s was because height probably gave them a competitive advantage in warfare.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/05/100517111910.htm">It&rsquo;s not true that the Maasai have a completely carnivorous diet</a>.</li>
<li>The increase in diseases during the agricultural revolution could be explained by the greater abundance of food from agriculture, which caused higher population densities, which often occurred while some humans had close proximity to domesticated animals, which led to the emergence and spread of many diseases.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It&rsquo;s possible that changes in diet could&rsquo;ve caused problems in the short term, but even if it did, such diseases likely would&rsquo;ve became less prevalent as humans adapt and evolve.</li>
<li>Once again, I don&rsquo;t see how this is relevant to the belief that it&rsquo;s healthier for most modern humans to eat meat.
We live in a world with excellent sanitation standards that have eliminated most of the diseases that arose.</li>
<li>Carnivore diet proponents repeatedly ignore all the diseases that people would acquire if they ate more meat (which are supported by both anecdotes <i>and</i> statistics), while emphasizing a small minority of anecdotal stories.</li>

<h3 id="digestive-system"><span class="section-number-3">3.3.</span> The Human Digestive System</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-digestive-system">
<div class="opponent" id="orgac0faca">
<p>
Is the human digestive tract more similar to a carnivore or a herbivore?<br>
(assume omnivore is not an option)
</p>

</div>
<p>
The human digestive tract is more similar to a carnivore than a herbivore:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Stomach acidity</b>: Humans have very acidic stomachs (pH 1.5-2.0), similar to carnivores, which helps break down proteins and kill bacteria in meat. Herbivores typically have much less acidic stomachs.</li>
<li><b>Intestinal length</b>: While humans have longer intestines than typical carnivores, our small intestine is proportionally much shorter than herbivores. Herbivores need extremely long digestive tracts (often 10-12 times their body length) to break down cellulose and extract nutrients from plant matter. Human intestines are about 4-5 times body length.</li>
<li><b>Cecum and appendix</b>: Herbivores have large, functional cecums where bacteria ferment plant material. Humans have a small, largely vestigial appendix and tiny cecum.</li>
<li><b>Enzyme production</b>: Humans produce strong protein-digesting enzymes (pepsin, various proteases) but lack cellulase to break down plant cell walls, unlike many herbivores.</li>
<li><b>Jaw structure</b>: Human jaws move primarily up and down for tearing and crushing, more like carnivores, rather than the side-to-side grinding motion of herbivores.</li>
<li><b>Teeth</b>: While humans have some grinding molars, we also have prominent canines and incisors designed for cutting, unlike the flat grinding teeth that dominate herbivore mouths.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p>
However, humans also show some adaptations for plant consumption, which reflects their evolutionary history as omnivores who could survive on varied diets depending on availability.
</p>

<p>
A lot of this boils down to how <a href="../pdfs/diet-and-human-evolution.pdf">humans evolved to cook their food</a>.
Due to this adaptation, humans to avoid eating the kinds of foods that are typically eaten by other animals with huge digestive systems.
The digestive systems of other great apes are also more similar to carnivorous systems as well.
Yet, we observe that they usually eat fruit and plants most of the time.
</p>

<p>
A major reason why the human digestive system is different from herbivore digestive systems is that herbivores tend to eat foods that aren&rsquo;t fit for human consumption.
There are still many plants, fruits, and vegetables that <i>are</i> fit for human consumption.
Even if the human digestive tract is more similar to a carnivore digestive system, it doesn&rsquo;t follow that it&rsquo;s unhealthy for humans to eat foods that are edible for humans.
</p>

<p>
In any case, there&rsquo;s no reason to insist that humans and great apes can only be one or the other.
They are all omnivores.
All life on Earth <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDPrvhLNuU">ultimately follows an opportunistic diet</a>, though some foods will be healthier or less for different animals.
</p>

<hr>
<div class="opponent" id="org8690ce1">
<p>
Which would be healthier for humans, a carnivore diet or a herbivore diet?<br>
(assume there are no other options)
</p>

</div>
<p>
A herbivore (plant-based) diet would likely be healthier for humans in the long term, despite our digestive anatomy being more similar to carnivores.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Cardiovascular health</b>: Extensive research shows plant-based diets are associated with lower rates of heart disease, lower blood pressure, and better cholesterol profiles.</li>
<li>Saturated fat and cholesterol from animal products are linked to increased cardiovascular risk.</li>
<li><b>Cancer prevention</b>: Large epidemiological studies indicate lower rates of colorectal, prostate, and other cancers among populations eating primarily plant-based diets.</li>
<li>Processed and red meats are classified as carcinogens by the WHO.</li>
<li><b>Longevity</b>: The world&rsquo;s longest-lived populations (Blue Zones) tend to eat predominantly plant-based diets with minimal animal products.</li>
<li><b>Diabetes and metabolic health</b>: Plant-based diets are associated with better insulin sensitivity and lower rates of type 2 diabetes.</li>
<li><b>Potential challenges with carnivore diets:</b> A pure carnivore diet risks deficiencies in vitamin C, fiber, and various phytonutrients.
It may also lead to kidney stress from high protein loads and increased risk of certain chronic diseases.</li>

<div id="outline-container-evolution" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="evolution"><span class="section-number-3">3.4.</span> The Problems With Claiming That Humans Evolved To Eat Meat</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-evolution">
<div class="opponent" id="orgfd45330">
<p>
It was necessary for earlier humans and their descendants to consume more energy-dense meat, rather than plants, in order to go through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_evolution#Encephalization">encephalization process</a>.
</p>

</div>

<p>
That&rsquo;s true.
However, just because our ancestors evolved to do something, that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s healthy.
Evolution favors those who have as many offspring as possible.
Evolution doesn&rsquo;t care if we get heart disease when we&rsquo;re in our 60s, or cancer in our 70s, or whatever, because people will have already had their children by then.
So the argument that people should eat something because their ancestors ate it is fallacious.
</p>

<p>
Our ancestors also didn&rsquo;t sleep on mattresses.
Our ancestors didn&rsquo;t brush their teeth.
Our ancestors didn&rsquo;t have refrigeration, antibiotics, or vaccines.
No sane person today would give up those technologies, just because our ancestors didn&rsquo;t have them.
It&rsquo;s a shallow way of thinking.
Moreover:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>All</i> humans and all life on Earth will eat whatever they can find opportunistically.<br>
See: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xDPrvhLNuU">The One Rule of Nature School Never Taught You &#x2013; Casual Geographic</a>.</li>
<li>Instead of pointing to specific examples for claiming that humans evolved to do this or that, we need to look at the entire picture.
What the entire picture shows is that all life on Earth will eat whatever food it can opportunistically find and consume if it will increase their caloric and nutritional intake.
A majority of humans and their ancestors ate plants for most of their evolutionary history.</li>
<li>The plants that we have today are not the same as what our ancestors had thousands of years ago.
These days, humans have access to the hundreds and thousands of plants that grew around the world, and can GMOs.
Technological changes like these make it possible to have a healthy plant-based diet with little to no meat, which is unlike the options that some of our ancestors had.</li>
<li>Even after most of the encephalization process occurred, most humans still ate plants for a majority of their diets.
That is especially true in the Americas where the human hunter gathers had hunted, killed, and eaten all of the big game animals until they went extinct, thus leaving agriculture and food/cannibalism stolen from enemy tribes as their main source of food.</li>
<li>So, it makes sense that plants tend to be healthier than meat for humans when we consider that most of our human ancestors ate plants for most of their history.</li>
<li>When the predecessors to humans transitioned from gathering to hunting, hunting was a better way to increase caloric consumption then gathering plants.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Agriculture later proved to be an even better way of increasing caloric consumption.</li>
<li>However, it&rsquo;s unlikely that humans could&rsquo;ve done agriculture straight from the get-go, since agriculture requires a lot of intelligence for more efficient and effective gains.</li>
<li>Agriculture probably would not have been possible if humans hadn&rsquo;t hunted beforehand and undergone selection for higher intelligence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If a proponent of the carnivore diet points to how hunting and eating meat caused the encephalization process, then I could just as easily point to how agriculture was necessary for humans to start forming civilizations.
Agriculture became the more dominant and efficient method for getting sufficient calories and nutrition for survival and reproductive success.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution">The Neolithic Revolution</a> happened for a reason.</li>

<p>
We can eat 99% of animals and we would be fine, while eating 99% of plants would kill us.
</p>

</div>
<p>
Wrong. Most people would eventually develop many health problems from only eating animals, including but not limited to problems from high cholesterol, less energy, nutrient deficiencies, IBS, etc.
That&rsquo;s true even if they could choose from 99% of all the animal species out there.
</p>

<p>
Yes, vegan diets require supplements for maximum health.
I&rsquo;ve never said otherwise.
I&rsquo;ve never advocated for veganism either.
Nevertheless, supplemented veganism would be far healthier than the carnivore fad diet.
Regardless, there&rsquo;s no need nor reason for anybody to choose between 99% animals or 99% plants for their diet.

<li>A diet that is heavy in red meat and/or dairy products is taxing on the environment since cattle require much more food and thus require much more land than what&rsquo;s required to raise poultry or fish.</li>
<li>There is no evidence to support the claim that using pesticides and such for growing crops would require killing <i>more</i> animals and rodents than what is required for raising and eating animals.
If it&rsquo;s true that raising cattle and such requires a lot of farmland for growing crops, then raising cattle should require killing more rodents as a side effect.</li>
<li>In any case, I don&rsquo;t care too much about how different foods and farming practices require killing more animals than others.

<li>There are <a href="#longevity">no known carnivores</a> who have lived into their late 80s, 90s, or 100s.

<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church">Seventh-day Adventists</a> are a population that existed since the mid-1800s, and they have many members who have gone their entire lifetime eating vegetables and plant-based diets and they are very healthy and long lived.

<li>The academic consensus strongly supports plant-based diets.</li>
<li>All or virtually all of the carnivore influencers out there don&rsquo;t have any backgrounds in nutrition.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s very telling that people who follow the carnivore diet get their information through videos, whereas people who follow Mediterranean diets tend to get their information from reading nutrition books.
<ul class="org-ul">

<li>Obesity rates in the United States have increased, even though <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKOQOP3G1go">sugar consumption has gone down over the past few decades</a>.

<h2 id="WFPB-popularity"><span class="section-number-2">6.</span> Why Aren&rsquo;t Whole-Food Plant-Based Diets More Popular?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-WFPB-popularity">
<p>
The components of a healthy diet are simple and straight-forward.
It&rsquo;s just a whole-food, plant-based diet.
So why don&rsquo;t more people buy plant-based whole foods?
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Plant-based whole foods are usually not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperpalatable_food">hyper-palatable</a>, so most people don&rsquo;t crave them.</li>
<li>A significant fraction of the population is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_literacy">health illiterate</a>, due to poor nutrition education, a public distrust in scientists, and low public intelligence.
Less intelligent people tend to eat less healthy.
When people don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s healthy for them, they tend to eat based on taste and cravings.</li>
<li>Ultra-processed foods usually have longer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelf_life">shelf lives</a> than whole foods.
Grocery stores, supermarkets, convenience stores, etc like to sell foods that minimize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrinkage_(accounting)">shrinkage</a>, which in turn increases profits.
This has resulted in many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert">food deserts</a>.
Businesses aren&rsquo;t focused on selling what&rsquo;s healthy.
Businesses are focused on selling what&rsquo;s makes money.</li>
<li><a href="https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/news/removing-meat-subsidy-our-cognitive-dissonance-around-animal-agriculture">The meat and dairy industry receive more subsidies from the US federal government than the produce industry</a>.
Government subsidies make the price of meat and dairy artificially low, compared to what they would be without subsidies.
If meat and dairy weren&rsquo;t subsidized, then more people would buy more produce, since produce would become more affordable in comparison.
The meat and dairy industries also sabotage public education in the United States and <a href="../civilization/activism#astroturfing">astroturf social media</a> to promote misinformation, which further contributes to the public&rsquo;s health illiteracy.<br>
Related Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUEpxdR7WnE">Exposing the Corruption Behind the New Diet Guidelines &#x2013; Viva Longevity (2026)</a>.</li>
<li>Produce markets are usually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition">perfect markets</a>.
Firms in perfectly competitive markets don&rsquo;t run ads because their products are identical.
Advertising would just increase their costs and drive up the prices, which means that customers will go to their competitors instead.
So it doesn&rsquo;t make economic sense for the produce industry to spend money advertising their foods to consumers.
The end result is that Americans don&rsquo;t buy as much produce as they should.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The fifth problem is the most complicated to understand.
It can be characterized as a tragedy of the commons.
If produce company A spent money on advertising, it might increase their profits if it persuades consumers to buy less ultra-processed foods and meat.
However, if produce company B spends no money on advertising, and they sell identical products to company A, then produce company B will receive the benefits of company A&rsquo;s advertising, without having to spend any money on advertising.
So even if company A&rsquo;s advertising is successful in persuading consumers to buy more produce, it may prove to be a net loss for the company.
Simply put, produce companies might be better off if they all contributed an equal amount of money on advertising their products.
But there&rsquo;s always the incentive for one or more companies to not spend money on advertising while the other companies pay the advertising expenditures.
So, the end result is that no produce companies spend money on advertising.
</p>

<p>
By contrast, the ultra-processed food industry is an oligopoly.
Oligopolies have the strongest incentives to spend money on advertising, compared to monopolies and perfect markets.
As expected, ads for ultra-processed foods emphasize the taste of their foods, and usually not how healthy they are compared to other foods.
If the produce industry ran ads, they would probably emphasize the health and the taste of their foods, but they don&rsquo;t run ads, since it&rsquo;s not profitable for them to run ads.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-longevity">
<p>
Minimizing the intake of carbohydrates consistently leads to shorter lifespans.
Ethnic groups that have meat heavy diets don&rsquo;t live very long:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_cuisine">The Mongolians eat a very meat-heavy diet</a>.
Yet, their average life expectancy is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Mongolia#Life_expectancy">less than 70 years old</a>.</li>
<li>The Inuit are famous for eating a 99% animal-based diet.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuit#Diet">The average Inuit life expectancy</a> is below 70 years old, which is 12-15 years lower than the average Canadian (~83 years).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Note that these life expectancy metrics are from modern times, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100602190350/http://discovermagazine.com/2004/oct/inuit-paradox/article_view?b_start:int=1&amp;-C=">after the Inuits shifted to more Western diets</a>.
This dietary transition actually <a href="https://www.atherosclerosis-journal.com/article/S0021-9150(02)00364-7/abstract"><i>reduced</i> the incidence of mortality</a> in the modern Inuit population.
The Inuits had even lower life expectancies on their traditional diet.
The cardiovascular risk of the traditional Inuit diet is severe.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
Carnivore health influencers don&rsquo;t live very long either:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMghM6TxiBk">How Long Do Health Influencers Live? Episode 1</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OofKicAiDpQ">How Long Do Health Influencers Live? Episode 2</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8Pm-m87sEc">How Long Do Health Influencers Live? Episode 3</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
By contrast, the average plant-based dieter lives a couple decades longer than the average carnivore does.
Some vegans even managed to make it into their 90s or 100s.
It may be surprising, but it is doable as long as they take supplements.
</p>


<p>
If the carnivore diet were optimal for longevity, then the traditional Inuits, Mongolians, and carnivore dieters would be among the longest living people in the world.
But they&rsquo;re clearly not.
If everybody ate as much meat as what carnivore proponents recommend, the world life expectancy would plummet dramatically.
This is really not up for debate.
It&rsquo;s a fact, even if some people don&rsquo;t like it and cannot accept the truth.
</p>



<p>
For most people, I would endorse the advice made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Viva-Longevity/videos">Viva Longevity</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5579.Eat_Drink_and_Be_Healthy">Walter Willett</a>.
However, I also recognize that the healthiest diets depend on genetics to some extent (e.g. the Inuit are some of the only people in the world who are well-adapted to a completely carnivorous diet).
A diet that works for one person won&rsquo;t necessarily work for another person, so individual experimentation is necessary for anyone to figure out what diet is best for them.
Nothing in this essay should be considered as medical, health, or dieting advice.
