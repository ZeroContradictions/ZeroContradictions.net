<h2 id="intro"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Introduction To This Critique</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
Most criticisms against Objectivism focus on Rand&rsquo;s support for selfishness, her condemnation of altruism, and her support for Capitalism and Libertarian principles.
They are naive and misguided about human nature, but this essay is not your typical critique of Objectivism.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s impossible to talk about all the problems with Objectivism in a single essay, especially for a philosophy that&rsquo;s described over multiple books and hundreds of pages.
It&rsquo;s also redundant when I have already written about these topics in depth on other webpages.
For those reasons, most of the sections on this page only give a short introduction into their respective topics, while linking to other webpages that talk about these issues in sufficient depth, compared to what&rsquo;s being displayed here.
</p>


<p>
To provide context and to present Rand&rsquo;s views accurately, there are quotations from Rand&rsquo;s works all throughout this essay.
If anybody thinks that I am misrepresenting Objectivism, please message me and explain why using <a href="../misc/contact">my contact page</a>.
My goal is to present Rand&rsquo;s philosophy correctly, not to misrepresent it.
I&rsquo;m only interested in what&rsquo;s true. I accept what&rsquo;s true, and I reject what&rsquo;s false.
</p>

<p>
Now we shall begin the critique.
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="correct-conclusions"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Correct Conclusions Made By Objectivism</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-correct-conclusions">
<p>
Compared to most philosophers, Rand was actually one of the best to have existed.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There is no such thing as supernatural phenomena (including a supernatural God).</li>
<li>She integrated Empiricism and Rationalism.</li>
<li>She had a good philosophy regarding concept formation, empiricism, existents, and percepts, and concepts. She makes some mistakes, but it&rsquo;s otherwise spot-on.</li>
<li>She formulated explicit standards for possible, probable, and certainty, while rejecting <a href="http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/arbitrary.html">arbitrary</a> notions.</li>
<li>Rational egoism is the best way to live.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>However, we justify this differently. Mine is more sound since it uses biological and evolutionary reasoning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Free markets and negative rights are good grounds for running a society.</li>
<li>Her proposed ethical virtues of: independence, integrity, honesty, justice, productiveness, egoism (or selfishness as she calls it), and pride are good virtues, aside from the fact that <a href="#objectivism-virtues-vices">all their descriptions are all corrupted by her flaky theory of value and moral assumptions</a>.</li>
<li>She may not have realized it, but Objectivism has considerable influence as an ideology because it has good memetic properties, especially with how it markets itself as a &ldquo;philosophy for life on Earth&rdquo;. I support using memetics for spreading rationality, and the <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/04/toward-rational-humanism.html">Rational Humanism value system</a>.</li>

<h2 id="axioms-problems"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> The Problems With Ayn Rand&rsquo;s Axioms</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-axioms-problems">
<blockquote>
<p>
An axiom is a statement that identifies the base of knowledge and of any further statement pertaining to that knowledge, a statement necessarily contained in all others, whether any particular speaker chooses to identify it or not. An axiom is a proposition that defeats its opponents by the fact that they have to accept it and use it in the process of any attempt to deny it. &#x2013; Galt’s Speech, For the New Intellectual, 155
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Basically, Ayn Rand considers &ldquo;axioms&rdquo; to be the same thing as propositions that can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performative_contradiction">proven by performative contradictions</a>.
Moreover, this isn&rsquo;t even the standard definition of &ldquo;axiom&rdquo; that most people use.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom">Wikipedia</a> and most dictionaries define &ldquo;axiom&rdquo; as:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
A statement that is taken to be true, to serve as a premise or starting point for further reasoning and arguments.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Axioms must also be as parsimonious as possible. The goal is to derive as much knowledge as possible from as few propositions as possible. Knowledge is information compression.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
An axiomatic concept is the identification of a primary fact of reality, which cannot be analyzed, i.e., reduced to other facts or broken into component parts. It is implicit in all facts and in all knowledge. It is the fundamentally given and directly perceived or experienced, which requires no proof or explanation, but on which all proofs and explanations rest.
The first and primary axiomatic concepts are “existence,” “identity” (which is a corollary of “existence”) and “consciousness.” &#x2013; Axiomatic Concepts, Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, 55
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As stated in the first quote, Rand&rsquo;s goal was to identify the base for knowledge, which she partially accomplished through the axioms that she identified, along with her support for empiricism and rationality being the only valid sources of knowledge.
However, she still fell short on multiple points:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>For starters, the <a href="../epistemology/performative-contradictions">Axioms of Classical Logic</a> are a far superior set of axioms for philosophy. And they actually count as real axioms, by the standard definition.</li>
<li><a href="../epistemology/performative-contradictions#axioms-and-basic-theorems">There are many other performative contradictions that can be made</a> besides the ones that she identified.</li>
<li>Supposedly, the Law of Non-Contradiction (LNC) is a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corollary#Noun">corollary</a> of the Identity Axiom. It would be more appropriate to establish the LNC as a separate axiom. In order to conclude the LNC from the Identity Axiom, you would have to assume (or implicitly assume) what you&rsquo;re trying to prove.</li>
<li>It would be more appropriate to establish existence and consciousness as corollaries instead, since they are proven using performative contradiction proofs.</li>
</ol>


<blockquote>
<p>
[A man&rsquo;s] means to establish the truth of his answers is logic, and logic rests on the axiom that existence exists. Logic is the art of non-contradictory identification. A contradiction cannot exist. &#x2013; Galt’s Speech, For the New Intellectual, 125
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Logic does follow from the existence axiom.
Logic exists because it&rsquo;s built into how the humans think.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The law of causality is the law of identity applied to action. All actions are caused by entities. The nature of an action is caused and determined by the nature of the entities that act; a thing cannot act in contradiction to its nature . . . . The law of identity does not permit you to have your cake and eat it, too. The law of causality does not permit you to eat your cake before you have it. &#x2013; Galt’s Speech, For the New Intellectual, 151
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Causality is not derived from the identity axiom.
Causality is built into how the humans think. Same with time.
We cannot escape them because <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/05/what-is-subjectivity.html">we cannot escape our subjectivity</a>.
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
Nothing is self-evident except the material of sensory perception. &#x2013; “Philosophical Detection”, Philosophy: Who Needs It, 13
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I would go a step further that <i>nothing</i> is self-evident at all since <i>anything</i> can be questioned.
</p>

<p>
Ayn Rand also claims that &ldquo;God&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t exist, without ever defining &ldquo;God&rdquo;.
The way Rand defines &ldquo;God&rdquo; is different from how a Catholic, a Hindu, a <a href="https://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_deism.html">deist</a>, a <a href="https://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_pantheism.html">pantheist</a>, etc each define &ldquo;God&rdquo; differently.
Rand has to define what she&rsquo;s talking about before she can claim that it doesn&rsquo;t exist, because it&rsquo;s entirely possible to create a definition of &ldquo;God&rdquo; that <i>does</i> exist in reality (e.g. defining God as &ldquo;whatever created the Universe&rdquo;).
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theological_noncognitivism">Theological Non-Cognitivism</a> is a better, more general position that asserts that whether or not &ldquo;God&rdquo; exists depends on how &ldquo;God&rdquo; is defined.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-subject-object-dichotomy">
<p>
I can&rsquo;t state enough just how important it is to understand the Subject-Object Dichotomy and its implications for forming an accurate and coherent philosophy.
It will <b>not</b> be possible to fully comprehend the metaphysical, epistemological, or axiological criticisms made in this essay if the reader does not understand the dichotomy.

<h3 id="determinism"><span class="section-number-3">4.1.</span> Mistaken Conclusions About Determinism and Physicalism</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-determinism">
<blockquote>
<p>
Determinism is the theory that everything that happens in the universe—including every thought, feeling, and action of man—is necessitated by previous factors, so that nothing could ever have happened differently from the way it did, and everything in the future is already pre-set and inevitable. Every aspect of man’s life and character, on this view, is merely a product of factors that are ultimately outside his control. Objectivism rejects this theory.

What is the meaning of the concept “truth”? Truth is the recognition of reality. (This is known as the correspondence theory of truth.) The same thing cannot be true and untrue at the same time and in the same respect. &#x2013; “Philosophical Detection”, Philosophy: Who Needs It, 14
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Truth is the product of the recognition (i.e., identification) of the facts of reality. Man identifies and integrates the facts of reality by means of concepts. He retains concepts in his mind by means of definitions. He organizes concepts into propositions—and the truth or falsehood of his propositions rests, not only on their relation to the facts he asserts, but also on the truth or falsehood of the definitions of the concepts he uses to assert them, which rests on the truth or falsehood of his designations of essential characteristics. &#x2013; “Definitions”, Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology, 48
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
All Objectivists have subconsciously adopted the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_theory_of_truth">Correspondence Theory of Truth</a>, but they never bothered to question whether it&rsquo;s actually right or not.
If people had direct knowledge of reality, then it wouldn&rsquo;t be possible for them to be wrong about anything.
People learn by experience (i.e. indirectly).
At most, people can build a mental model of what they <i>think</i> reality is, but they can never build a <i>perfect</i> knowledge of reality because omniscience is impossible.
If the model is wrong, then they have to readjust their knowledge to form a more accurate model of reality.
</p>

<p>
Objectivism does acknowledge that it&rsquo;s possible for ideas to be wrong, and that wrong ideas should be changed if they don&rsquo;t match reality, but if that&rsquo;s the case, then that implies that knowledge and truth about reality are formed according to a <i>mental model</i>, i.e. sensory input and reason do not provide direct knowledge of reality.
</p>

<p>
Objective truth doesn&rsquo;t exist for similar reasons.
Conscious minds can only have <a href="#subject-object-dichotomy">subjective</a>, perspective-dependent models of that <a href="#subject-object-dichotomy">objective reality</a>.
No proposition can ever be truly be labeled as &ldquo;objectively true&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s always possible to be wrong about that said propositions if further knowledge of reality invalidates that proposition&rsquo;s truth value assignment.
Truth is essentially the same thing as knowledge, because whatever people &ldquo;know&rdquo; is whatever they will assert to be &ldquo;true&rdquo;.

Rand seemed to understand that language is subjective (at least implicitly):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Language is a conceptual tool—a code of visual-auditory symbols that denote concepts. To a person who understands the function of language, it makes no difference what sounds are chosen to name things, provided these sounds refer to clearly defined aspects of reality. But to a tribalist, language is a mystic heritage, a string of sounds handed down from his ancestors and memorized, not understood. To him, the importance lies in the perceptual concrete, the sound of a word, not its meaning. . . . &#x2013; The Voice of Reason, 121

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-immortal-robot-wrong-conclusions">
<blockquote>
<p>
In ethics, one must begin by asking: What are values? Why does man need them?<br />
“Value” is that which one acts to gain and/or keep. The concept “value” is not a primary; it presupposes an answer to the question: of value to whom and for what? It presupposes an entity capable of acting to achieve a goal in the face of an alternative. Where no alternative exists, no goals and no values are possible.<br />
&#x2026;<br />
To make this point fully clear, try to imagine an immortal, indestructible robot, an entity which moves and acts, but which cannot be affected by anything, which cannot be changed in any respect, which cannot be damaged, injured or destroyed. Such an entity would not be able to have any values; it would have nothing to gain or to lose; it could not regard anything as for or against it, as serving or threatening its welfare, as fulfilling or frustrating its interests. It could have no interests and no goals. &#x2013; The Virtue of Selfishness, 15
</p>
</blockquote>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A simpler thought experiment that arrives at the same conclusions and provides better insight would be to imagine a universe that has no sentient life at all. This thought experiment takes less explaining to get the point across, and it is more readily apparent that all value ultimately originates from sentient life, because a universe with no sentient life is a universe with no value at all.</li>
<li>This proves that all value is subjective, since value originates from sentient organisms, and different organisms have different values. &ldquo;Objective Value&rdquo; is an oxymoron.</li>
<li>Morality is based on value, <a href="https://stateofthenihil.wordpress.com/2019/09/22/reason-is-not-the-basis-for-morality/">not reason</a>. If objective value doesn&rsquo;t exist, then objective morality cannot exist either. Morality is therefore subjective since it is based on Value, which is based on the perspectives(s) of sentient life.</li>
<li>Most humans do intuitively derive their purpose and meaning from doing things that sustain their lives (<a href="../misc/industrial-society-and-its-future-manifesto#power-process">the power process</a>), but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make it the chosen life purpose for <i>all</i> humans.</li>
</ol>
<p>
There is no uniquely rational way to define value philosophically.
To illustrate this, if we were to ask: &ldquo;What is the best theory of value?&rdquo;, then we would need a theory of value in order to answer the question because it&rsquo;s a normative question.
But we can&rsquo;t use a theory of value to answer the question if we haven&rsquo;t already established the right theory value that we should use.
This infinite regress demonstrates that there is no foundation for value in philosophy.
</p>

<p>
Since we cannot judge values unless we have already chosen a value framework beforehand, it is inaccurate to claim that <i>all</i> values can/should be derived from valuing life, reason, purpose, and self-esteem.
It would be more accurate to claim that we have higher levels values that all affirm each other, which collectively lower levels of values, and so on.
</p>

<p>
At most, we can define a theory of value and use it to justify itself, hence why <a href="../epistemology/axiology#reproduction-objective-purpose">life and reproduction are intuitively good values</a>.
But that still doesn&rsquo;t conclude that life is the objective value.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The Objectivist ethics holds man’s life as the standard of value—and his own life as the ethical purpose of every individual man.
The difference between “standard” and “purpose” in this context is as follows: a “standard” is an abstract principle that serves as a measurement or gauge to guide a man’s choices in the achievement of a concrete, specific purpose. “That which is required for the survival of man qua man” is an abstract principle that applies to every individual man. The task of applying this principle to a concrete, specific purpose—the purpose of living a life proper to a rational being—belongs to every individual man, and the life he has to live is his own.
Man must choose his actions, values and goals by the standard of that which is proper to man—in order to achieve, maintain, fulfill and enjoy that ultimate value, that end in itself, which is his own life. &#x2013; The Virtue of Selfishness, 25
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As a counter-example, Efilists value exterminating all the life on Planet Earth, and <a href="../misc/case-against-efilism#argument-for-efilism">they could justify it with reasons that many people would find appealing</a>.
There are no objective reasons why the Efilist&rsquo;s values are &ldquo;better&rdquo; or &ldquo;worse&rdquo; than the Life-Affirmer&rsquo;s values.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, unlike truth, value is not convergent for similar brains because <a href="../FAQs/post-overton-FAQs#when-life-becomes-zero-sum">it&rsquo;s possible for people to have conflicting positive and negative value judgments</a>, especially in an environment with scarce resources.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Tom and Joe could have identical brains, but make very different value judgments from their perspectives.

Their value judgments are identical in one way, but opposite in another way.
Joe positively values Joe dating Sally, and negatively values Tom dating Sally.
Tom positively values Tom dating Sally, and negatively values Joe dating Sally.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-objective-morality-nonsense">
<blockquote>
<p>
Ethics is an objective, metaphysical necessity of man’s survival. . . .
I quote from Galt’s speech: “Man has been called a rational being, but rationality is a matter of choice—and the alternative his nature offers him is: rational being or suicidal animal. Man has to be man—by choice; he has to hold his life as a value—by choice; he has to learn to sustain it—by choice; he has to discover the values it requires and practice his virtues—by choice. A code of values accepted by choice is a code of morality.”
The standard of value of the Objectivist ethics—the standard by which one judges what is good or evil—is man’s life, or: that which is required for man’s survival qua man.
Since reason is man’s basic means of survival, that which is proper to the life of a rational being is the good; that which negates, opposes or destroys it is the evil. Since everything man needs has to be discovered by his own mind and produced by his own effort, the two essentials of the method of survival proper to a rational being are: thinking and productive work. &#x2013; “The Objectivist Ethics,” The Virtue of Selfishness, 23
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Reason is not synonymous with morality, nor can reason alone serve as a basis for morality because the true basis for morality is value, <a href="#immortal-robot-wrong-conclusions">as established in the last section</a>.
Moral relativism is a corollary that follows from this.
The subjectivity of morality debunks the entire foundation of the Objectivist theory of ethics, to the point that everything must be re-thought from the ground up.
Although a lot of the political philosophy ends up the same in the end, and it is important to understand the different reasoning that arrived at these conclusions.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, irrationality is <i>not</i> the origin of all evil.
&ldquo;Evil&rdquo; People aren&rsquo;t evil because they&rsquo;re irrational.
They&rsquo;re &ldquo;evil&rdquo; because either: 1. they need to fight against others for scarce resources to survive, or 2. they have a value system that opposes other perspectives.
Deeming anything &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;evil&rdquo; implies a value judgment of some kind, and we can&rsquo;t make judgments unless we have already adopted an a priori theory of value.
</p>

<p>
If anything, it&rsquo;s irrational to unilaterally declare anything to be &ldquo;evil&rdquo; or to view morality as black and white because that entails having unquestioned implicit assumptions.
Even if morality were objective, there&rsquo;s always more ways to be wrong than there are ways to be right, so anybody who <i>thinks</i> that they are abiding by supposedly objective moral standards is probably wrong.
Many people would also use their belief that they are imposing the one and only true &ldquo;objective&rdquo; morality as a justification to rule with an iron fist.

<p>
An emotion as such tells you nothing about reality, beyond the fact that something makes you feel something. Without a ruthlessly honest commitment to introspection—to the conceptual identification of your inner states—you will not discover what you feel, what arouses the feeling, and whether your feeling is an appropriate response to the facts of reality, or a mistaken response, or a vicious illusion produced by years of self-deception . . . .
In the field of introspection, the two guiding questions are: “What do I feel?” and “Why do I feel it?” &#x2013; “Philosophical Detection”, Philosophy: Who Needs It, 17
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
eeeeeeeeeeee
</p>

<p>
Emotions exist to make people better at reproducing and raising offspring.
Emotions are needed to generate actions in the real world.
Note that I am <i>not</i> saying here that we should put emotions before reasoning, or anything like that.
I&rsquo;m only explaining why animals evolved to have emotions, and the function of emotions, which Ayn Rand failed to do.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Romantic love, in the full sense of the term, is an emotion possible only to the man (or woman) of unbreached self-esteem: it is his response to his own highest values in the person of another—an integrated response of mind and body, of love and sexual desire. Such a man (or woman) is incapable of experiencing a sexual desire divorced from spiritual values. &#x2013; “Of Living Death”, The Voice of Reason, 54
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This paragraph misunderstands why love exists, mainly because it&rsquo;s viewing love from <a href="#subject-object-dichotomy">a subjective point of view, instead of an objective point of view</a>.
Love exists because it made our ancestors more efficient at procreating and raising children who would live to adulthood to have children of their own.
In the past, male and female organisms who didn&rsquo;t have love or strong emotional bonds towards each other were less likely to stay together to raise their offspring, which endangered their offspring&rsquo;s probability of survival.
On the other hand, animals who did evolve to a capacity to romantically love one another were more likely to stick together to protect their children from accidents and predators, thus increasing their reproductive success.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The capacity to experience pleasure or pain is innate in a man’s body; it is part of his nature, part of the kind of entity he is. He has no choice about it, and he has no choice about the standard that determines what will make him experience the physical sensation of pleasure or of pain. What is that standard?* His life*.
The pleasure-pain mechanism in the body of man—and in the bodies of all the living organisms that possess the faculty of consciousness—serves as an automatic guardian of the organism’s life. The physical sensation of pleasure is a signal indicating that the organism is pursuing the right course of action. The physical sensation of pain is a warning signal of danger, indicating that the organism is pursuing the wrong course of action, that something is impairing the proper function of its body, which requires action to correct it. The best illustration of this can be seen in the rare, freak cases of children who are born without the capacity to experience physical pain; such children do not survive for long; they have no means of discovering what can injure them, no warning signals, and thus a minor cut can develop into a deadly infection, or a major illness can remain undetected until it is too late to fight it. &#x2013; “The Objectivist Ethics”, The Virtue of Selfishness, 17
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Rand is correct that pain and pleasure are biological motivators.
Pain and pleasure are evolutionarily designed to trigger and provide impetus for sentient organisms to do things that sustain their lives and reproduction.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In what manner does a human being discover the concept of “value”? By what means does he first become aware of the issue of “good or evil” in its simplest form? By means of the physical sensations of pleasure or pain. Just as sensations are the first step of the development of a human consciousness in the realm of cognition, so they are its first step in the realm of evaluation. &#x2013; “The Objectivist Ethics”, The Virtue of Selfishness, 17
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is naive. Pain isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;evil&rdquo;.
It&rsquo;s an emotion that necessary for generating motivation.
Likewise, pleasure isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;good&rdquo;.
Pleasure is a decrease in motivation.
Pleasure isn&rsquo;t always a good thing either, since a low state of motivation would make it difficult for humans to do anything in their lives.

Another thing that Rand has overlooked is that reason isn&rsquo;t necessarily the <i>only</i> valid source of knowledge since emotions are a source of value knowledge when it comes to ethics.
Natural instincts such as a fear of spiders and falling from high heights should also be considered knowledge.
They indicate that such things threaten our odds of survival.

<p>
It is true that people can and should lie to a criminal or an abusive government if it will lessen the harm that the perpetrator does.
And it is also true that lying in most other situations will require that the individual must avoid getting caught and punished.
I agree that lying can cause a person to lose their independence in the sense that they become dependent on other finding out about their lies, but there&rsquo;s no reason why a person shouldn&rsquo;t lie if lying will benefit them <i>and</i> they can get away with it without any negative consequences.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps a liar or a thief would feel guilt and would be unable to go through the power process of obtaining items/money via their own labor, but there&rsquo;s no reason why they should feel that way if they understand that <a href="#immortal-robot-wrong-conclusions">there&rsquo;s no foundation for value or morality</a>.
The benefits of honesty are <i>not</i> enough to compel people towards &ldquo;good&rdquo; behavior in the absence of government and other means of resolving game-theoretical problems.
</p>

<p>
<a href="../#fake-research">Academia is designed to cultivate just as much intellectual dishonesty as it promotes honest research</a>, but Objectivists don&rsquo;t recognize or address this.
</p>

<p>
If Objectivists truly practiced the virtue of honesty, then they would reject the philosophy and start over by understanding applied evolutionary biology, and how it relates to humans.

<p>
But how does one determine a criterion for evaluating the character and actions of men, in view of the fact that men possess the faculty of volition? What science can provide an objective criterion of evaluation in regard to volitional matters? Ethics. Now, do I need a concept to designate the act of judging a man’s character and/or actions exclusively on the basis of all the factual evidence available, and of evaluating it by means of an objective moral criterion? Yes. That concept is “justice.” &#x2013; Ayn Rand
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Objectivism emphasizes judging everybody and everything according to reason.
This is a reasonable position that I do not contest.
What I do object to are the values that Objectivism preaches for judging everything.
We&rsquo;ve already covered the <a href="#immortal-robot-wrong-conclusions">problems with Objectivism&rsquo;s theory of value and morality</a>.
</p>

<p>
A minor thing that I will nitpick here is that Objectivism thinks that there&rsquo;s no rational basis for judging people based on race.
<a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#averages-and-exceptions">Every person <i>should</i> initially be given the benefit of the doubt, regardless of what their race is</a>.
<a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#environmental-factors">However, the reality is that some races are genetically predisposed to be more/less violent, more/less intelligent, and more/less cooperative than others</a>.
It <i>is</i> reasonable to take someone&rsquo;s race into account when judging the probability that they will do a given type of action, and it is also reasonable to reassess those probabilities after getting to known an individual better.
</p>

<p>
Objectivists also believe that they shouldn&rsquo;t spend/waste their time doing something if they don&rsquo;t perceive it to benefit them.
I agree with this in principle, but since they have unquestioned assumptions and they are the judge of whether or not someone/something benefits them, they can&rsquo;t accurately judge whether something will benefit them or not.

Rand gives mostly good advice on pride, but it still encounters the same problems as the other virtues, i.e. a <a href="../epistemology/axiology#intro">rational theory of value</a> for establishing the virtue (what we should be proud of) must be determined beforehand.

<p>
Work is required by nature, and it&rsquo;s often important to a &ldquo;fulfilling&rdquo; life.
Objectivism does a good job in defining and preaching productiveness in the context of a modern, industrial society, but there are still problems with it.

<ul class="org-ul">

If every single person was doing what they absolutely love in life, then the world economy would <i>not</i> continue to function properly.
A better and most realistic way to think about life, careers, and relationships is like fishing.
The people who say that &ldquo;people should follow their passions&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;people should do what they love&rdquo; are already passionate about doing what they do, so their advice sets an impossible high bar for everyone else.
Some spots are beautiful to you and will help you catch fish, but other spots won&rsquo;t, but you can&rsquo;t know where you would like to spend time until you go there and you can&rsquo;t know how many fish you will catch there until you try.
The younger you are, the more time you can spend sailing to different spots and the older you are, the more time you get to spend in places you know you like, refining your abilities to catch fish there.

<p>
To interpose the threat of physical destruction between a man and his perception of reality, is to negate and paralyze his means of survival; to force him to act against his own judgment, is like forcing him to act against his own sight.

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Rand argues that using &ldquo;force&rdquo; is unethical and irrational because it supposedly takes away a person&rsquo;s ability to reason.
There are multiple problems with this:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>&ldquo;Force&rdquo; is arbitrary and poorly defined (a &ldquo;floating abstraction&rdquo; as Rand would call it), especially if <a href="../civilization/case-against-libertarianism#NAP">it&rsquo;s defined according to the Non-Aggression <del>Principle</del> Spectrum</a>.</li>
<li>A person can still reason even if there&rsquo;s force being exerted against them. People do it everyday. People who pay taxes aren&rsquo;t able to reason any better or any worse than people who don&rsquo;t. Defendants must also use reason to argue for their release when they are held in a courtroom.</li>
<li><a href="https://zerocontradictions.github.io../epistemology/free-will#agency-is-circumstantial">Agency is circumstantial</a>. Most people have to deal with decisions that are much more &ldquo;forceful&rdquo; than taxation or complying with legal codes, in the sense that they have the agency to pay taxes, and have comparatively far less agency to make tougher decisions between greater conflicting values.</li>
<li>It does not follow that force is unethical or irrational on the basis that it takes away another person&rsquo;s ability to reason. This argument is rationalizing, not a rational argument. In fact, there are many cases where it&rsquo;s rational to prevent or weaken another person(s)&rsquo;s ability to reason <a href="#life-is-violent">if they have conflicting values</a>.</li>

<p>
Now we shall address some Objectivist arguments regarding why they think force is objectively bad.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
When people hurt others, it&rsquo;s ultimately bad for their survival and reproduction in an intelligent society.
People hurt others because their lower-level processes and instincts haven&rsquo;t been corrected by reason yet.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You don&rsquo;t eliminate violence with &ldquo;reason&rdquo;.
You eliminate it within a society by using a government that <a href="../civilization/political-philosophy#goals-of-government">solves game-theoretical problems</a>.
And as we&rsquo;ll see in the future, this unusual era of peace that has largely persisted in humanity for the last 80 years will only continue to exist if governments are reformed to also <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/07/natural-resource-taxation.html">manage resource scarcity</a> and <a href="../FAQs/overpopulation-FAQs">population control</a>.
In a resource-scarce environment, people hurt others because they&rsquo;ll starve to death if they don&rsquo;t.
This is why <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html">warfare occurred throughout human history for thousands of years</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/07/circles-of-control-and-freedom.html">A society can eliminate violence within the society</a>, especially if it&rsquo;s intelligent and prosperous, but we still have to recall that the elimination of violence in that society occurs because the society resolved the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma with respect to violence.
People (usually) don&rsquo;t commit violence in such a society because they live under circumstances that discourage violence while making it easy to make a living without resorting to violence.
Since the human propensity for violence is <i>always</i> circumstantial, we cannot assume that that non-violence is a natural consequence of being &ldquo;rational&rdquo;.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Just start robbing your neighbors while trying to live a good life, and tell me when it starts working out for you.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This bad-faith claim ignores that robbing people in our current world would occur in the context of a society with rules that outlaw violence, a society that solves the <a href="../civilization/political-philosophy#PDs">Societal Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma</a>.
On the other hand, if a thief can manage to steal things without getting caught, then the thievery works out for the thieves.
They manage to acquire free stuff without having to pay for it.
</p>

<p>
Objectivists tend to counter-argue that the thieves would feel guilt and would be unable to go through the power process of obtaining items/money via their own labor, but there&rsquo;s no reason why they should feel that way if they understand that <a href="#immortal-robot-wrong-conclusions">they have a different conception of morality and/or they recognize that there&rsquo;s no foundation for value or morality</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
There is a fundamental moral difference between a man who sees his self-interest in production and a man who sees it in robbery. The evil of a robber does not lie in the fact that he pursues his own interests, but in what he regards as to his own interest; not in the fact that he pursues his values, but in what he chose to value; not in the fact that he wants to live, but in the fact that he wants to live on a subhuman level. &#x2013; “Introduction”, The Virtue of Selfishness, ix
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Humans have been stealing from each other for all of human history, including the ancestors of everybody who&rsquo;s reading this webpage right now.
We wouldn&rsquo;t exist if humans didn&rsquo;t steal from others, because <a href="#life-is-violent">humans are selfish, violent, and competitive</a>.
I&rsquo;m not saying that stealing is a &ldquo;good&rdquo; thing, I&rsquo;m saying that if humans have to do in order to survive, then they will.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
All of that is easily taken care of by basic logic.
What happens when you rape and kill people?
What will others do to you out of their fear of you?
Is what they do good or bad for your continued life as a human?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Committing crimes may endanger a person&rsquo;s survival and ability to procreate <i>within a functioning society</i>, but <a href="#immortal-robot-wrong-conclusions">values and morality are still subjective</a>.
There are no objective reasons why a criminal should value his own life and reproductive success over committing crimes.
On the other hand, if raping, killing, and stealing are reproductively successful strategies in an environment, then that&rsquo;s exactly what evolution will select for.
That fact is not changed by reason or &ldquo;basic logic&rdquo;.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Individuals can use their ability to reason to eliminate violence on an individual level.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Not really. <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#race-gap-crime-rates">Different genes</a> and different circumstances affect people&rsquo;s propensities for violence, so violence is often beyond people&rsquo;s control, on an individual level.

A government is the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control—i.e., under objectively defined laws.<br />
The source of the government’s authority is “the consent of the governed.” This means that the government is not the ruler, but the servant or agent of the citizens; it means that the government as such has no rights except the rights delegated to it by the citizens for a specific purpose. &#x2013; “The Nature of Government”, The Virtue of Selfishness, 109-110

The correct goal of government is to resolve Prisoner Dilemmas and Tragedies of the Commons.
Government comes from the necessity to create a reasonable set of laws that would create a societal framework from which selfish individuals can cooperate together for greater mutual gain (than if they didn&rsquo;t cooperate together).
Cooperation is the foundation of civilization, and the best legal code is the one that enables that to the greatest extent possible.

There&rsquo;s no such thing as collective entities. There&rsquo;s only individuals.

<p>
No one is claiming that collectives are not composed of individuals.
But you can&rsquo;t think of collective entities as <i>isolated</i> individuals (e.g. the United States government, Ford Motors, the Free Software Foundation, etc).
Collectives exist as a mental concept because it&rsquo;s useful to think of them that way.
We don&rsquo;t achieve anything by denying that we can think of them as concepts.
The United States government, Ford Motors, the Free Software Foundation, etc are not single individuals.
They could never function as the work of only a single person.
Collective entities are defined as individuals who work together in specialized roles within a power structure to create a functional system that dedicates itself towards a goal.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;Collective Values&rdquo; benefit majorities by oppressing minorities. They are a dangerous concept.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The existence of minorities does not cause collective entities to break down as a concept.
As mentioned, all collective entities consist of a <i>power structure</i>, so it is implied that most people in the collective do not have equal power (in most cases) to get <i>exactly</i> what they want (which would be world-domination for most people, because <a href="#life-is-violent">life is selfish</a>).
Minorities can be harmed by collective interests, but that&rsquo;s just part of nature <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html">(1)</a>, <a href="https://expandingrationality.substack.com/p/circles-of-order-and-chaos">(2)</a>, <a href="https://expandingrationality.substack.com/p/the-modern-problems-with-conformity">(3)</a>, <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/07/circles-of-control-and-freedom.html">(4)</a>.
If a collective entity should never override the desires of a minority, then laws against theft, murder, rape, etc shouldn&rsquo;t exist either because they override the desires of criminals.
People can opt out of society any time they&rsquo;d like, but as soon as they do so, they become an outsider.

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A mixed economy is a mixture of freedom and controls—with no principles, rules, or theories to define either. Since the introduction of controls necessitates and leads to further controls, it is an unstable, explosive mixture which, ultimately, has to repeal the controls or collapse into dictatorship. A mixed economy has no principles to define its policies, its goals, its laws—no principles to limit the power of its government. The only principle of a mixed economy—which, necessarily, has to remain unnamed and unacknowledged—is that no one’s interests are safe, everyone’s interests are on a public auction block, and anything goes for anyone who can get away with it. Such a system—or, more precisely, anti-system—breaks up a country into an ever-growing number of enemy camps, into economic groups fighting one another for self preservation in an indeterminate mixture of defense and offense, as the nature of such a jungle demands. While, politically, a mixed economy preserves the semblance of an organized society with a semblance of law and order, economically it is the equivalent of the chaos that had ruled China for centuries: a chaos of robber gangs looting—and draining—the productive elements of the country.
A mixed economy is rule by pressure groups. It is an amoral, institutionalized civil war of special interests and lobbies, all fighting to seize a momentary control of the legislative machinery, to extort some special privilege at one another’s expense by an act of government—i.e., by force. In the absence of individual rights, in the absence of any moral or legal principles, a mixed economy’s only hope to preserve its precarious semblance of order, to restrain the savage, desperately rapacious groups it itself has created, and to prevent the legalized plunder from running over into plain, unlegalized looting of all by all—is compromise; compromise on everything and in every realm—material, spiritual, intellectual—so that no group would step over the line by demanding too much and topple the whole rotted structure. If the game is to continue, nothing can be permitted to remain firm, solid, absolute, untouchable; everything (and everyone) has to be fluid, flexible, indeterminate, approximate. By what standard are anyone’s actions to be guided? By the expediency of any immediate moment.
The only danger, to a mixed economy, is any not-to-be-compromised value, virtue, or idea. The only threat is any uncompromising person, group, or movement. The only enemy is integrity. &#x2013; “The New Fascism: Rule by Consensus”, Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal, 206

<a href="http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/anarchism.html">Although Rand was a harsh critic of Anarchism</a>, many of her followers are Anarcho-Capitalists since Objectivist Ethics are a gateway into believing in Anarcho-Capitalism.
Anarcho-Capitalists are just as ignorant about human nature as Communists are, and their political ideology is equally dangerous to Modern Civilization.
Many of them will be reading this critique, so this has to be addressed.
</p>

<p>
The Anarcho-Objectivists are a case of <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/07/status-pyramid-schemes.html">purity spiraling among the Objectivist community</a>.
For that reason, Objectivism is a net-negative to civilization because Ancaps are more opposed to Georgism than literally every other political ideology out there.
They are thus <a href="../civilization/georgism-crash-course">the greatest opponents to solving the greatest economic problems that are facing the modern world</a>.
So although Objectivism advocates for a pro-free-market philosophy, it ironically (albeit indirectly) promotes an extremely anti-free market philosophy since <a href="../civilization/case-against-libertarianism#free-markets-circular-reasoning">it&rsquo;s not possible to have free markets at all without a government to establish them</a>, nor is it possible to have <a href="#equal-negative-land-rights">free markets without equal negative land rights for everybody</a>.

Setting Anarcho-Objectivism aside, even standard Objectivism still promotes ideas that are harmful to the preservation of modern civilization due to its obsession with individualist libertarian morals.
<a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs">Racial denialism</a>, opposition to eugenics, and free-range immigration policies will increase the proliferation of dysgenics in modern society, <a href="../FAQs/overpopulation-FAQs">cornucopian delusions</a> will increase the risk of civilization collapsing due overpopulation in the long run, and an <a href="../civilization/philosophy-of-technology.html #technology">overly optimistic and one-sided view of technology</a> will distract humanity from addressing the problems created by the evolutionary mismatch in our world.

It is a shame that tens of millions of dollars are wasted every year promoting Objectivism by the Ayn Rand Institute and the Atlas Society, when all that money could be spent promoting higher quality philosophy and creating truly rational thinkers for tackling the greatest problems of the 21st century.

<p>
Nevertheless, <a href="#correct-conclusions">I do agree with Objectivism on this list of bullet points</a> that I wrote in the introduction.
Although I&rsquo;m clearly not a fan of Ayn Rand&rsquo;s philosophy, I would say that she had a better philosophy than most of the humans or philosophers who had ever lived prior to the creation of the Internet.
