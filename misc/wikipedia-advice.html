Advice: Only focus on writing or editing what you&rsquo;re interested in.
For the longest time, my reach exceeded my grasp when I wanted to learn literally everything.
</p>

<p>
In 2021, I wanted to edit every under-developed Wikipedia article I had ever seen, even if those articles were not among the most interesting topics that I prefer to think about.
In 2024, I significantly narrowed down the list of Wikipedia articles that I want to edit down to the ones that I am highly interested in anything.
Although there are literally thousands of Wikipedia articles out there that I could use my time and effort to improve, it isn&rsquo;t worth trying to work on all of them, because there&rsquo;s many other things that I value doing in life more, which is namely, racing your family, and working to make money to support said family.
</p>

<p>
There are billions of different things and ideas that I could spend my time thinking about in this world.
That being said, I&rsquo;m the kind of person who wants to find out the top 1% most important things that I could possibly be thinking about at any given moment, and unfortunately, that is no easy task.
But I do know that I&rsquo;m not going to find any of that kind of must-know information inside a bunch of news outlets striving to make money by putting in front of my eyes whatever will catch my attention.
They have a conflict of interest between making money with click-bait titles versus telling me what I <i>should</i> be thinking about.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-improving-wikipedia">
<p>
The {{wiktionary}} template could help you make a lot of new edits to Wikipedia.
Example: {{wiktionary|objective|objectivé}}
</p>

<p>
On Wiktionary, the {{wikipedia}} template could help you make a lot of new edits to Wiktionary.
Example: {{wikipedia|Objectivity}}
</p>

<p>
You should add the {{cn}} template to any claim that you think is likely to be true, but is missing a reliable secondary source.
If you see claims that are unverified (and likely to be false), then you can just remove them.
Wikipedia has an official rule that any claims without citations can be removed.
</p>

<p>
If you&rsquo;re trying to edit an article to make it more non-partisan, it helps to prepare your edits offline with a text editor and computer files.
When you&rsquo;re finally ready to commit your changes to Wikipedia, you should do them all at once.
This decreases the probability that opposing editors will see your edits and be able to act quickly on them, compared to if you make one edit at a time, and allow enough time to pass between edits for other editors to see the page(s) and revert them or otherwise reverse your changes.
</p>

<p>
Sandwiching multiple controversial edits between multiple non-controversial edits.
</p>

<p>
Some of the Wikipedia articles that get the highest pageviews can be thought as having a sort of &ldquo;Overton Window&rdquo; regarding how far they can be shifted towards wokism versus realism.
</p>



<p>
For Emacs, I recommend using <a href="https://launchpad.net/mediawiki-el">mediawiki.el</a> to enable syntax highlighting and other features for editing WML text.
However, it lacks features that I&rsquo;m used to using with org-mode in Emacs, like foldable header sections and imenu integration.
As of January 2025, I am unaware of any superior Emacs modes or packages for editing in Wiki Markup language.

<h3 id="humanist-bias"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Wikipedia Has Humanist/Leftist Biases</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-humanist-bias">
<p>
If you know of a bias, then you can correct for it.
But if you don&rsquo;t know of a bias and you&rsquo;re on the fence, then you can be persuaded towards the direction of the bias without realizing it.
</p>


<p>
I noticed that many of the more left-wing sentences on Wikipedia are more likely to include multiple citations rather than the usual one or two for each sentence.
it’d be interesting if some corpus compiled all the sentences from every Wikipedia article and sorted the senses by how many citations that they have. My prediction is that the sensors that have more citations than usual will feature both citations that back up more statements and they will on average be more leftist than the average or most realistic public consensus perspective.
I should Google and see if anybody has done any analysis or studies on this.
</p>

<p>
Another reason why we should expect there to be a correlation between sentences that present left-wing political views, and the number of citations that a sentence has is that political phenomena are easier to understand than technical STEM phenomena.
If an editor is politically biased, then they don’t need to understand the details of whatever they’re siding with too much as long as they understand that the conclusion aligns with their beliefs, and that they can cite to reinforce their beliefs.
When I’m reading articles about technical subjects on Wikipedia, I rarely see more than one or two citations for each sentence because these topics are much harder for most people to understand and they often require reading dense jargon-heavy academic books and papers in order to retrieve the citations.

Wikipedia focuses on &ldquo;verifiability, not &rdquo;truth&ldquo;.

<p>
Wikipedia can be used to introduce to a topic, but information from Wikipedia cannot be cited as information for the topic. -This should be a contradiction because the only two consistent beliefs are: 1) Wikipedia is a credible source for learning information and can thus be cited, or 2) Wikipedia is not credible and can&rsquo;t be used at all.
If you wouldn&rsquo;t trust Wikipedia to teach the topic in depth or cite information from it, then why would you trust it to give you a reliable introduction to the topic? Wikipedia articles often have errors, especially for statistical information and partisan topics, but aside from these are the articles any more likely to have errors than other sources?
Furthermore, Wikipedia articles aren&rsquo;t very good teaching resources for beginners trying to learn topics in STEM fields.
They do often feature valuable images and gifs that help with explaining topics, have great first sentences that summarize the topic information, many comprehensive sections and links, and of course valuable information, but it would be more efficient to learn the topics with a beginner friendly resource, use wikipedia to supplement that knowledge, and use wikipedia to find other topics worth learning about.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It isn&rsquo;t managed by a corporation aiming to make profit, so it doesn&rsquo;t have an economic incentive to exaggerate details, purposely catch attention, or flat-out lie to make a profit.</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t have an incentive to unevenly cover different concurrent topics (based on which ones will draw the most profit and interest). Thus, the information I read is more balanced on all kinds of different concurrent topics, and one does not receive more attention than another. In fact, the length of an article often (but not always) indicates the importance of its topic.</li>
<li>It is relatively unbiased compared to most news outlets, and it tends to report multiple perspectives too, often with different headings for each.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>However, Wikipedia does have a strong left-wing bias.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All articles are written in third-person, which reduces personal biases and can even cause the writers and readers to think more objectively.</li>
<li>News outlets often control the information by choosing which people to invite and voice their opinions, and sometimes they won&rsquo;t let them speak or clearly articulate their message.
For that matter, cable news takes all the downsides of spoken debates (compared to textual debates) and incorporates those negative flaws into itself. Cable news is also very well-known to photo/video-shop.</li>
<li>It is a tertiary source instead of a secondary source, with links to various secondary and sometimes even primary sources.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Can tertiary sources refer to primary sources?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It links to other articles with information relevant to the first article.</li>
<li>It is multilingual, so I can read the same article in different languages as long as there is an article written in that language. Sometimes the different language articles have different information written in each of them, but at least they are available. By contrast, most news outlets usually don&rsquo;t provide news in more than one language.</li>
<li>No ads</li>
<li>No clickbait</li>
<li>Few conspiracy theories</li>
<li>It is slower to report the news, but the advantage is that it&rsquo;s less likely to report fake/exaggerated/etc news. And besides, when would I have to know something in the news immediately?</li>
