Note: I created most of this list in 2021, when I dreamed of becoming a prolific Wikipedia editor.
Unfortunately, I still haven&rsquo;t learned how to edit Wikipedia fast and effectively, since I decided to create a philosophy website instead.
I thus haven&rsquo;t made as many contributions to Wikipedia today as I had hoped, and I wish I had gotten into Wikipedia editing during my teens or earlier.
</p>

<p>
If you&rsquo;d like to collaborate with me on contributing to any of these topics, please reach out to me on my <a href="../misc/contact">contact page</a>, and we can look into it!
</p>

<p>
These lists are pretty messy, but I will hopefully clean this list up someday and make some of these edits happen.
My interests and views today are also not the same as my views from 2024, so some of these topics, so some of the information here may outdated.

<h2 id="punti-hakka-clan-wars"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Regarding The Taishanese And The Punti-Hakka Clan Wars</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-punti-hakka-clan-wars">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>During the early 1800s, conflict occurred between Cantonese and Portuguese pirates in the form of the Ningpo massacre after the defeat of Portuguese pirates.[22] The First (1839–1842) and Second Opium Wars (1856–1860) led to the loss of China&rsquo;s control over Hong Kong and Kowloon, which were ceded to the British Empire. Macau also became a Portuguese settlement. Between 1855 and 1867, the Punti-Hakka Clan Wars caused further discord in Guangdong and Guangxi. The third plague pandemic of 1855 broke out in Yunnan and spread to the Liangguang region via Guangxi, killing thousands and spreading via water traffic to nearby Hong Kong and Macau.</li>
<li>The turmoil of the 19th century, followed by the political upheaval of the early 20th century, compelled many residents of Guangdong to migrate overseas in search of a better future. Up until the second half of the 20th century, the majority of overseas Chinese emigrated from two provinces of China; Guangdong and Fujian. As a result, there are today many Cantonese communities throughout the world, including in Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, the Americas, the Caribbean and Western Europe, with Chinatowns commonly being established by Cantonese communities. There have been a large number of interracial marriages between Cantonese men and women from other nations (especially from Cuba, Peru, Mexico ), as most of the Cantonese migrants were men. As a result, there are many Black Caribbeans and South American people who of Cantonese descent including many Eurasians and people Cantonese ancestry,[23] for example Nancy Kwan, born to a Cantonese father and Scottish mother, is a well-known Hollywood actress in the 1960s; and influential martial artist Bruce Lee, who was born to a Cantonese father and a half-Chinese, half-Caucasian mother.</li>
<li>After 1864, the Central Pacific Railroad received the same Federal financial incentives as the Union Pacific Railroad, along with some construction bonds granted by the state of California and the city of San Francisco. The Central Pacific hired some Canadian and European civil engineers and surveyors with extensive experience building railroads, but it had a difficult time finding semi-skilled labor. Most Caucasians in California preferred to work in the mines or agriculture. The railroad experimented by hiring local emigrant Chinese as manual laborers, many of whom were escaping the poverty and terrors of the war in the Sze Yup districts in the Pearl River Delta of Guangdong province in China.[46]:7 [47]:15–37 When they proved themselves as workers, the CPRR from that point forward preferred to hire Chinese, and even set up recruiting efforts in Canton.[48] Despite their small stature[49] and lack of experience, the Chinese laborers were responsible for most of the heavy manual labor since only a very limited amount of that work could be done by animals, simple machines, or black powder. The railroad also hired some black people escaping the aftermath of the American Civil War.[50] Most of the black and white workers were paid $30 per month and given food and lodging. Most Chinese were initially paid $31 per month and provided lodging, but they preferred to cook their own meals. In 1867 the CPRR raised their wage to $35 (equivalent to $650 in 2020) per month after a strike.[48][51][52] CPRR came to see the advantage of good workers employed at low wages: &ldquo;Chinese labor proved to be Central Pacific&rsquo;s salvation.&rdquo;[53]:30</li>
</ul>

<p>
Message To Make To Other Editors At Some Point:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I&rsquo;ve read on Wikipedia that most of the fighting took place around the Toi Shan of the Sze Yup counties. If I am not mistaken, this would mean that most of the people in the first wave of Asian immigrants to the United States were also the first wave of refugees to the United States, which would explain why most Chinese-Americans in the 1800s were specifically Taishanese.</li>
<li>As it relates to me, my Cantonese great-grandfather was born in San Francisco in 1883. I know that both of his parents were born in Guangdong according to the US census data, but this video now has me wondering if they were refugees in addition to laborers.</li>
<li>Do you have any sources where I could possibly read more about this?</li>
<li>Note: Upon further research, although some of the Cantonese immigrants in the 1800s may have been refugees, it would be inaccurate to say this for most of them since the majority of them were men who came to work and send remittance money back home to their impoverished families, and over half of the Chinese women in California in 1870 were prostitutes (many by coercion). Nonetheless, the Hakka-Punti Wars are still one of the greatest, if the not the greatest, factor regarding the Taishanese diaspora.</li>

<h2 id="japanese-phonology"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Japanese Phonology Article And Related Topics</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-japanese-phonology">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Rewrite the first paragraph to say that suffixed gemination occurs with voiceless obstruents, whereas suffixed partial gemination involving the nasal archiphoneme occurs with voiced obstruents?</li>
<li>Edit the vowels table to include the short vowels and long vowels side-by-side to help eliminate confusion?: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Vowels">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Vowels</a>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It should look more like this vowel table: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawan_language#Phonology">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okinawan_language#Phonology</a></li>
<li>If the table was labeled &ldquo;Vowel Qualities&rdquo;, this wouldn&rsquo;t be necessary, but since it is labeled &ldquo;Vowel Phonemes&rdquo; and vowel length is phonemic in Japanese, by definition, it does not include <b>ALL</b> of the phonemic vowels of Japanese.</li>
<li>Replace the occurrence of &ldquo;mora phoneme&rdquo; with &ldquo;mora archiphoneme&rdquo; for less ambiguity? It is noted to be an archiphoneme at the end of the paragraph, so this change should be less confusing and easier to read for a linguistics-savvy reader like myself, who was confused until I read the end of the paragraph.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Should this section be called &ldquo;Lenition&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Weakening&rdquo;? &ldquo;Lenition&rdquo; seems more common and more standard in academic linguistic usage: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Weakening">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Weakening</a></li>
<li>Edit the header title &ldquo;Full-sized&rdquo; with &ldquo;Full-sized (tsu)&rdquo; for extra clarity?: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokuon#Appearance">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokuon#Appearance</a></li>
<li>Mention how <i>u</i> is rounded in the Kansai dialect (and possibly other dialects as well?) (use the same source from the Kansai dialect article): <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Vowels">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Vowels</a></li>
<li>Include the &rsquo;〜&rsquo; symbol before the &rsquo;WO&rsquo; hiragana character in this section to consistently match the one that follows it?: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Vowels">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Vowels</a></li>
<li>Include &rsquo;pocky&rsquo; as another example of a rare word-initial [p] in Japanese?: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Consonants">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Consonants</a></li>
<li>Combine the sentence below into a single sentence? The part about the glide (CjV) feels out of place, and should appear after (CV) morae are mentioned: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Phonotactics">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Phonotactics</a>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A mora may be &ldquo;regular&rdquo; consisting of just a vowel (V) or a consonant and a vowel (CV), or may be one of two &ldquo;special&rdquo; moras, <i>N</i> and <i>Q</i>. A glide <i>j</i> may precede the vowel in &ldquo;regular&rdquo; moras (CjV).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Is this paragraph missing a citation?:  However, <i>ɡ</i> is further complicated by its variant realization as a velar nasal [ŋ]. Standard Japanese speakers can be categorized into 3 groups (A, B, C), which will be explained below. If a speaker pronounces a given word consistently with the allophone [ŋ] (i.e. a B-speaker), that speaker will never have [ɣ] as an allophone in that same word. If a speaker varies between [ŋ] and [ɡ] (i.e. an A-speaker) or is generally consistent in using [ɡ] (i.e. a C-speaker), then the velar fricative [ɣ] is always another possible allophone in fast speech.</li>
