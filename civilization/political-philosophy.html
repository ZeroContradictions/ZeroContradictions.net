<h2 id="intro"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Prerequisites For Understanding This Political Philosophy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
If you want to understand this political and ethical philosophy, the best way to start would be to read the book and <a href="../index.html#bio-realism">all the essays listed on the biological realism section of the website</a>.
This political philosophy is based on understanding the implications that evolutionary theory has for the human race and human societies. Humans are a biological species, so they cannot be understood without a very firm understanding of biology.
</p>

<p>
We also recommend reading <a href="../epistemology/axiology.html">our philosophy of value</a> and our <a href="../FAQs/post-overton-FAQs.html#problems-with-deontological-ethics">essay on the superiority of consequentialist ethics</a>.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-constitutional-principles">

How to govern society is one of the oldest philosophical problems, and while there aren&rsquo;t always perfect solutions to every problem, there are still pragmatic and heuristic approaches that we can take.

<h3 id="practicality-of-constitutions"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> The Practicality of Constitutions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-practicality-of-constitutions">
<p>
The de facto power of the United States Constitution is weaker than the de jure power of the Constitution, but this isn&rsquo;t surprising. At the end of the day, a Constitution is just a piece of paper created by the government to limit what the government can do. If the government had the power to create the constitution and enforce it, then it can just as easily have the power to stop enforcing parts of it or even ignore it completely.
</p>

<p>
If government has to exist, then it&rsquo;s reasonable to have a document of rules describing what the government must aim to do, as well as what it can and cannot do. Even most anarchists have implicit rules for their societies, and they would have to have a document that explicitly states the rules of their &ldquo;societies&rdquo; if they were actually serious about their ideas. So, it&rsquo;s still worth creating a Constitution that states the explicit rules of society and figuring out the best characteristics that a Constitution should have.
</p>

<p>
Conclusion: In order for a Constitution to have the true power and enforcement that its authors intended it to have, Constitutions must be enforced <b>directly</b> by the people instead of the government. It cannot be stressed enough that the citizens much be vigilant to veto, rebel, and reform if the legal system ever proposes an anti-constitutional update to the legal code, lest <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/05/the-deep-state-and-myth-of-democracy.html">a deep state will form</a>.

<h3 id="goals-of-government"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Political Philosophy And The Goals Of Government</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-goals-of-government">
<p>
The foremost goal of government is to resolve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma">Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemmas</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">Tragedies of the Commons</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem">Free-Rider Problems</a>. Government comes from the necessity to create reasonable sets of laws that will create a societal framework from which selfish individuals can cooperate together for greater mutual gain (than if they didn&rsquo;t cooperate together). Cooperation is the foundation of civilization, and the best legal code is the one that enables that to the greatest extent possible.
</p>

<p>
The relationship between a government and its citizens is called a &ldquo;social contract&rdquo;, but it shall instead be called an <b>Implicit Mutual Social Agreement (IMSA)</b> in this essay. Every time the word &ldquo;contract&rdquo; is used, some people complain that it&rsquo;s not really a contract because they never signed it. And while they&rsquo;re right about that, they&rsquo;re missing the point. The idea is that if you want the benefits that society gives you, then you have to comply with society&rsquo;s rules, even if you don&rsquo;t like all the rules. You can&rsquo;t have your cake and eat it too. If you&rsquo;re going to break the IMSA, then society is justified to prosecute you.

<h4 id="PDs"><span class="section-number-4">2.2.1.</span> Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemmas</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-PDs">
<p>
The Societal Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma (SCP) is the most fundamental game theoretical problem that every society must solve. Once a community of humans surpasses roughly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar&rsquo;s Number</a>, it becomes possible for humans to take advantage of others without other people being able to suspect it because not everybody knows each other. This creates incentives for every individual to either: 1. kill, abuse, and steal from other people when it makes them better off, or 2. be bound to also kill, abuse, and steal from other people as a reaction to other people who are doing the same thing. The resolution of the SCP requires an enforced legal code that enables cooperation. Societies cannot exist without cooperation, and cooperation between strangers cannot exist unless the Societal Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma is solved.
</p>

<p>
In the absence of a law enforcement that would punish people for committing crimes, every person has an incentive to kill, abuse, and steal from other people because these actions make it easier to gain the resources for supporting oneself and one&rsquo;s desires, compared to if they had labored and traded with other people instead. If only one person is defecting while everybody else is cooperating with each other, then this scenario is analogous to either of the two scenarios in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma">standard Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma</a> where one party cooperates while the other defects from the other, except that there could be any number of people cooperating and defecting at the same time.
</p>

<p>
When it&rsquo;s easy and feasible for one person to defect from cooperating with everybody else (Anarchy &amp; Lawlessness), everybody else is also incentivized to defect from everybody else too. If this happens, then this scenario is analogous to how the two parties involved in the standard Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma are both defecting from each other, except that this defection applies to <b>everybody</b> in the area of lawlessness, not just two people.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, neither of these scenarios are desirable in comparison to a prosperous society where each person&rsquo;s labor produces wealth that is guaranteed to not be stolen or abused by other people, and where people can safely trade commodities and money to make each other better off with the guarantee that the other side will be punished if they don&rsquo;t hold up their side of the trade. Read More: <a href="../civilization/case-against-libertarianism.html#ancaps-and-game-theory">Why cooperation isn&rsquo;t necessary in every person&rsquo;s best interests</a>.
</p>

<p>
The best scenario (as well as the only scenario that can create a functioning society) is when every person cooperates with each other. In practice, this can only be achieved by a government that imposes the rule of law, which effectively eliminates every person&rsquo;s incentive to defect, since the penalties and punishments for defecting (breaking the law) are too costly and the probability of getting caught breaking the law are near ~100%. Note that the exact probability doesn&rsquo;t matter as long as it&rsquo;s reasonably high enough to punish nearly all defectors and to discourage other from defecting. The imposition of this law is involuntary by definition because <b>every</b> person has to abide by it whether they like it or not. On the other hand, a &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; imposition of law would be an oxymoron because every person would disobey the voluntary law and defect in the Societal Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma when it suits their self-interests. Law can thus only be involuntary and involuntarily imposed.
</p>

<p>
The previously mentioned scenario comes with an important caveat that doesn&rsquo;t exist in the standard Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma. When the government enforces the rule of law, some members of the government may choose to &ldquo;defect&rdquo; from the rest of the society by abusing their power to better achieve their self-interests. Such is the Nature of Game Theory and the intrinsic selfishness of life. But this is still better and more functional than an Anarchist world where literally <b>everybody</b> is defecting from each other, not just a handful of people who are in control of a strong government. Even if the government defects from the people whose interests it&rsquo;s supposed to represent, that&rsquo;s still fewer people defecting and thus a more prosperous society, compared to the alternative (Anarchy). How to govern society is one of the oldest philosophical problems, and while there aren&rsquo;t any ideal solutions that can completely eliminate corruption, there are some pragmatic principles and heuristics that we can follow to generate a better society.

<p>
A free-rider problem is a situation where most people do the necessary contributions for making the community thrive, while a minority of people reap the benefits of the majority&rsquo;s effort while contributing nothing in return.
</p>

<p>
When a minority of a people can benefit by doing nothing, this incentivizes everybody else who is doing their part to reconsider that they could also do nothing instead, while getting the same benefits, for everybody else gains. When this happens, the free-rider problem becomes more similar to a tragedy of the commons, but they were different initially.

It&rsquo;d be nice if we could have a society that fixes problems <i>before</i> they happen, instead of <i>after</i> they happen.

&ldquo;We the People&rdquo; is a commonly repeated phrase when talking about American history and values, but who are &ldquo;The People&rdquo; exactly? Constitutions always say that the government must serve the people, but they never define who the &ldquo;people&rdquo; are. For example, slaves weren&rsquo;t considered part of &ldquo;the people&rdquo; in the US until 1865, and neither were Native Americans until 1924. Some more examples include:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Foreign-born citizens? They weren&rsquo;t sometime in the past, but now they are.</li>
<li>Men? Or men <i>and</i> women? (women didn&rsquo;t gain suffrage in Western countries until the 1900s)</li>

<li>Mixed race people with ancestry of one of the ethnic groups of an ethnically homogenous country?</li>

[this section is still in development]
</p>

<p>
When people say &ldquo;Never trust the government&rdquo; or ask &ldquo;Do you trust the government?&rdquo;, what do they even mean? Government is very complex. There&rsquo;s local, state, and federal levels, different branches of government, different agencies and departments of government, and many different people who all work for the government.
</p>

<p>
When conservatives say &ldquo;Never trust the government&rdquo;, they still usually trust government entities like the FDA, the USPS, local utilities, other government agencies, and probably many favored politicians. And when libertarians and anarchists say the tagline, they typically have even less trust and approval for the government as a whole (as it currently exists) compared to conservatives, but even they will still depend on at least a few functions of government to do things that they need.
</p>

<p>
So what specifically about the government should not be trusted? Any particular departments, agencies, or people filling administrative roles? And generally speaking, what aspects of government can be trusted?
</p>

<p>
Also, how does one define &ldquo;trust&rdquo;? Certainly there are different levels of trust, so what levels of trust can be applied to each component of the government? Are there different types of trust, or are they all the same thing?

<p>
A politician can do what&rsquo;s best for the constituents in their district, but that won&rsquo;t necessarily be what&rsquo;s best for the entire world as a whole. For example, a local lawmaker/governor might criticize a local company for outsourcing labor that would take jobs away from their constituents (particularly in the short-term), even if that actually might be what&rsquo;s best for the entire world as a whole. The company wins because it reduces its labor costs, the newly hired laborers overseas win because they acquire higher-paying jobs, and the community that initially lost jobs will eventually win in the long-term too (assuming that laid-off workers can find new jobs) since they can purchase cheaper goods and services. Conceptually, this concept can be expanded to other assets too, like determining which localities gets the most government funding and infrastructure, who gets the new Fortune 500 facility, etc. This is one reason why government often works against the people, and unfortunately it happens very often. A more efficient government/reason-system ought to not do this.
</p>

<p>
All political systems are oligarchies, regardless of how they present themselves. Leaders of centralized systems know almost nothing about a lot of things, rather than a lot about a few things. It&rsquo;s not possible for a single person to rule an entire country all by themselves because they need subordinates who will enforce their rule of law. Likewise, it&rsquo;s equally impossible for a democracy to work effectively unless it has representatives and a hierarchy of other government officials. It has to be that way, but it also creates problems with running the society.
</p>

<p>
Bureaucracies have a tendency to shift to self perpetuation over time. There are a few things that can be done to mitigate that. For starters, public sector unions are almost always bad since they&rsquo;re focused on promoting the interests of their workers, i.e. they&rsquo;re focused on perpetuating the bureaucracy, so perhaps they should be outlawed.
</p>

<p>
It is easier for public figures to voice opposition to bad ideas when they have no political power.
Al Gore criticized the Patriot Act, but if he had won the 2000 US presidential election, then he would have surveilled the country too by abusing governmental power, just like George W. Bush did. The legislation for the Patriot Act was already written up waiting for the signal. 9/11 was that signal. As for when the Coronavirus left China, there was no legislation waiting for it since no one was expecting it. But the spread of the virus outside of China and its over-estimated perception of deadliness was still the signal for every politician to go full tyrant.

Similar to how &ldquo;just doing what the teacher wants&rdquo; may not be what&rsquo;s best for the student, politicians who are &ldquo;just doing what their constituents want&rdquo; may not necessarily be what&rsquo;s best for the country.

<a href="../misc/industrial-society-and-its-future-manifesto.html#strategy">From Industrial Society And Its Future</a> by Dr. Ted Kaczynski:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Paragraph #187: On the more sophisticated level the ideology should address itself to people who are intelligent, thoughtful and rational. The object should be to create a core of people who will be opposed to the industrial system on a rational, thought-out basis, with full appreciation of the problems and ambiguities involved, and of the price that has to be paid for getting rid of the system. It is particularly important to attract people of this type, as they are capable people and will be instrumental in influencing others. These people should be addressed on as rational a level as possible. Facts should never intentionally be distorted and intemperate language should be avoided. This does not mean that no appeal can be made to the emotions, but in making such appeal care should be taken to avoid misrepresenting the truth or doing anything else that would destroy the intellectual respectability of the ideology.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph #188: On a second level, the ideology should be propagated in a simplified form that will enable the unthinking majority to see the conflict of technology vs. nature in unambiguous terms. But even on this second level the ideology should not be expressed in language that is so cheap, intemperate or irrational that it alienates people of the thoughtful and rational type. Cheap, intemperate propaganda sometimes achieves impressive short-term gains, but it will be more advantageous in the long run to keep the loyalty of a small number of intelligently committed people than to arouse the passions of an unthinking, fickle mob who will change their attitude as soon as someone comes along with a better propaganda gimmick. However, propaganda of the rabble-rousing type may be necessary when the system is nearing the point of collapse and there is a final struggle between rival ideologies to determine which will become dominant when the old world-view goes under.

<h3 id="corporal-punishment-and-humiliation"><span class="section-number-3">6.2.</span> Why Corporal Punishment And Humiliation Can Sometimes Be More Practical Punishments Than Making Prisoners Spend Years In Prison</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-corporal-punishment-and-humiliation">
<p>
It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to punish taxpayers by forcing them to pay money that is used to imprison people who broke the law. Why should a lazy criminal have their existence be funded by good, productive people who are actually contributing to society? Imprisoning someone for several years is a detriment to everybody in society.
</p>

<p>
A better way to punish the criminals without wasting taxpayers&rsquo; money is to use corporal punishment instead of prison sentences more often. This way, the lawbreakers are punished, and the taxpayers don&rsquo;t have to pay the price for keeping the lawbreakers locked up in prison. Physical punishment works in Singapore, and Singapore has some of the lowest per capita crime rates in the world (although race and economic factors undoubtedly help with this too). The people who get punished may be unable to work for a few days while they heal from the injury and are experiencing the pain, but then they&rsquo;ll have to go back to work in order to sustain themselves, and taxpayers won&rsquo;t have to subsidize their existence.
</p>

<p>
Western opposition to corporal punishment is just a cultural thing. In Singapore, there is at least a sizable amount of public support for corporal punishment. And after all, aren&rsquo;t some crimes deserving of corporal punishment, like rape, massive pyramid schemes, torturing, or severe physical abuse?
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">People cannot imagine what it&rsquo;s like to spend 5 years in prison.</span> Especially if it&rsquo;s often far longer than that, it completely ruins someone&rsquo;s life. People cannot intuitively understand how bad that is. And once the prisoners finally leave the prison, how are they supposed to get back into the real world and return to a normal lifestyle? They could go back to the outside world, but it would be completely alien to them because it wouldn&rsquo;t be the same world they had left before they were incarcerated. Some recently released prisoners wouldn&rsquo;t even want to go back out into the real world because they&rsquo;ve become so familiar with the prison world, hence why people often get re-incarcerated immediately after they leave prison.
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">Physical punishment also invokes primal instincts,</span> which could increase its effectiveness and people&rsquo;s willingness to commit crimes. If the brain can be roughly divided into about three parts, then the fear of corporal punishment and strong desire to avoid it works off the most basic structures within the human brain. Both of these proposed punishments are based on incentives, and utilize both psychological and economic principles. Being soft on crime causes crime. And making people spend several years in prison when it&rsquo;s a very costly and ineffective punishment counts as being soft on crime.
</p>

<p>
Performing physical punishment publicly could improve its intended effects. Being caned in the townsquare for everybody would humiliate the person being punished. This converts corporal punishment from a purely psychological force for discouraging/preventing crime into a social force as well. It could even become a eugenic force if it discourages people from working with the penalized people. This would cause they would make less money, and thus they would have fewer children.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, a prisoner could be offered assisted suicide. Then the taxpayers don&rsquo;t have to subsidize their existence, and the prisoner then has no further opportunities to pass their genes onto the next generation. In most cases, it would be better for everybody if people serving multiple life sentences in prison were sentenced to death instead, but the main reason why this doesn&rsquo;t happen is because it conflicts with people&rsquo;s moral dogmas.

<p>
The branch of government that is responsible for describing problems to be solved for monetary rewards and distributing the rewards to the winners would also provide rewards for people who solve major mathematical and/or scientific problems. Currently, there are no monetary rewards for completing many unsolved mathematical problems, but providing rewards could incentivize more people to attempt completing them.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-climate-change-most-ideal-solution">
<p>
The most ideal solution to climate change would be for a global government that to regulate how much of the atmosphere can be altered and in what way(s). Different countries likely have differing opinions on how the atmosphere should change since it would affect climates, crop types/growths, ocean depth levels (and thus affect coastal lands), and much more.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-climate-change-best-solution" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="climate-change-best-solution"><span class="section-number-3">10.2.</span> The Most Likely Way How Humanity Will Solve Climate Change</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-climate-change-best-solution">
<p>
Since we don&rsquo;t have a global government for effectively regulating and enforcing pollution and CO<sub>2</sub> emission policies, the next best solution to global warming is to alter the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere to block out more heat / sunlight, which would lower the global temperature to counter the rising temperatures of recent decades. Without a global government, any attempt to do things like climate pledges will succumb to a global Tragedy of the Commons. That&rsquo;s why the best solution we have now will be to block slightly more sunlight out of the atmosphere, since it could reduce global warming without facing game-theoretical dilemmas to its implementation.
</p>

<p>
Doing what we can to prevent climate change is a no-brainer. The Earth has been facing record-breaking temperatures for the past two centuries thanks to the changes in the atmosphere caused by the Industrial Revolution. And since humans evolved during the Ice Age when the planet was much cooler, it makes sense that we would want to keep the Earth at a cooler temperature than the temperatures that we are predicting decades from now.
</p>

<p>
We will have to be careful about this since technology in general is unpredictable and this technology has never been tried before, but if we don&rsquo;t do this, the Earth&rsquo;s climate and environment is going to continue to negatively change to the detriment of us humans and all other living species. Fortunately though, we have observed the effects of how sending tons of volcanic ash into the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere can cause global temperatures to drop by blocking out sunlight, so we at least have some idea of how to go about this and some of the possible outcomes.
</p>

<p>
Although this proposal would end (or even reverse) global warming, it might not completely prevent climate and environmental change. One example is that coral reefs would still be harmed by the increased acidity of the ocean water since the quantity of carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere and oceans would continue to increase (although they would still benefit from global temperatures no longer increasing or even decreasing). Pollution taxes (a carbon tax in this case) would still be reasonable, even if the atmosphere was altered to block out more sunlight. Developed countries that have already emitted a lot of carbon dioxide should be taxed more since they&rsquo;ve already made up their share for causing causing climate change.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-overpopulation-vs-climate-change">
<p>
Overpopulation is a thousand times more problematic than pollution or climate change is. They all exacerbate each other, but once there&rsquo;s overpopulation, it&rsquo;s basically <a href="../FAQs/overpopulation-FAQs.html#if-no-pop-regulation">game over for civilization</a>. Overpopulation causes Civilizations to fight wars with each other over scarce resources, until they finally collapse from nearly decimating each other.
</p>

<p>
Civilization rose and fall in the Mayan world many times over thousands of years. There was a constant cycle of growing civilization, overpopulation, and collapse. Life continued that way in the Americans for thousands of years until the Europeans came and build a civilization that wouldn&rsquo;t collapse and fall&#x2026; but maybe we should wait several more decades to see if another collapse happens.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-most-likely-enforcement">
<p>
The government will start with the least authoritarian and least invasive methods for enforcing population control. If those methods work for enforcing the law, then they will become the status quo. It will be a felony for anyone to have children without a reproduction license, so there will already be strong incentives for people to comply with the law.
</p>

<p>
If unlicensed children are born, but the parents would still be responsible for paying for the child&rsquo;s existence, and paying back society for the incurred costs. This could be done by fining the parents at a fee that is 50% higher than the cost of a reproduction license. If they are unable to pay that, then they will be placed in a debtor&rsquo;s prison until they pay off their debt to society. They will also be monitored with regular birth control testing to ensure that they don&rsquo;t break the law again.

<h2 id="education-system"><span class="section-number-2">13.</span> The Education System</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-education-system">
<p>
There will be a public education system and a voucher system. This will be similar to health insurance in the United States where healthcare is provided by private companies, but there will be a public safety net for everybody else. Parents who don&rsquo;t want to enroll their children into the public education system would not have to pay taxes to fund it, and would only have to pay for their children&rsquo;s private education expenses.

<p>
There&rsquo;s a good argument for a government-provided safety net for education. Public education can have a unifying effect on the collective values of society, which helps reduce the variance of the society&rsquo;s values. In a society, you want to distribute the risks of life among everybody, and that&rsquo;s why safety nets on a collective level are a good idea.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-public-healthcare-skepticism">
<p>
It can be argued that a public healthcare system could make the general population healthier on average, but this ignores the fact that a public healthcare system would subsidize people who don&rsquo;t take care of their health. This means that healthy people would have to pay the cost of that since it&rsquo;s not possible to subsidize every demographic within an economy. Subsidizing is redistribution basically.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, a public healthcare system would increase the dysgenics of the population. As mentioned in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recent_human_evolution#Early_Modern_Period_to_present">this Wikipedia article on Recent Human Evolution</a>, people who smoke tend to have fewer children since smokers have shorter lifespans. By providing healthcare to smokers and other people with unhealthy lifestyles, we are helping their undesirable genes stay in the gene pool by greatly reducing that selectionary pressure on the population, and that certainly isn&rsquo;t good for society in the long-term.
</p>

<p>
If we&rsquo;re focused on achieving a society that will last thousands or tens of thousands of years or so, then it would be better if the people who live the unhealthy lifestyles die off naturally via natural selection. In the long term, that would result in a much healthier population where healthy people don&rsquo;t have to subsidize unhealthy lifestyles.

<p>
Global government is important for equally distributing countries&rsquo; natural resources. It is tremendously unfair that the citizens in countries with abundant natural resources in proportion to their populations (e.g. Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, etc) get to have their lives subsidized by the government&rsquo;s ability to sell the abundant natural resources that are present on their lands, instead of having those natural resources be own equally by the entire world&rsquo;s population and managed by a global government. This contributes to increasing the dysgenics of the world&rsquo;s population.

<h4 id="why-global-government"><span class="section-number-4">16.3.1.</span> Why should there be a global government? Can&rsquo;t nation-state governments suffice?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-why-global-government">
<p>
Global government is <i>necessary</i> in order to resolve critical game theoretical problems on a global scale. Solving game-theoretic problems is exactly what a government is supposed to do, and a global government simply does that a global scale. Some examples of game-theoretic problems that are best resolved by global government are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Overpopulation</li>
<li>Global warming and carbon emissions</li>
<li>Enforcing Georgism and the conservation of the Earth&rsquo;s natural resources</li>
<li>Regulating the pollution done by each country</li>
<li>Preventing wars to the fullest extent possible (wars could potentially destroy modern civilization)</li>
<li>Resolving geopolitical conflicts in order to ensure geopolitical stability</li>
<li>Et Cetera</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-global-government-responsiveness" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="global-government-responsiveness"><span class="section-number-4">16.3.2.</span> But aren&rsquo;t smaller-scale governments more responsive and representative?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-global-government-responsiveness">
<p>
It depends on the situation. But even if this premise is true, it doesn&rsquo;t refute the fact that a global government is still <i>necessary</i> in order to resolve critical game theoretical problems on a global scale, lest everyone on Earth shall face potentially catastrophic consequences.
</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;re going to have some type of de facto global power structure no matter what happens.
Today, that is currently the United Nations, combined with the influence of the Chinese and American superpowers, and other international organizations.
An explicit, limited government is better than a hidden web of power, or a balance of power between hostile societies.
</p>

<p>
Also, moving problems somewhere else doesn&rsquo;t accomplish anything. If nation-state governments are less effective for solving a game-theoretic problem instead of a global government, then a global government should take care of the problem instead.

<div id="outline-container-government-levels-authoritarianism" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="government-levels-authoritarianism"><span class="section-number-4">16.3.3.</span> Aren&rsquo;t higher levels of government more authoritarian?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-government-levels-authoritarianism">
<p>
Maybe, but the same could be said about literally any scale of government. Local governments can be extremely authoritarian, state governments can be extremely authoritarian, national governments can be extremely authoritarian, etc. The key thing to notice here is that even though it&rsquo;s obvious that bigger governments have the power to be authoritarian on a greater scale than smaller governments, it still made more sense to build higher and higher levels of government throughout the history of Humanity. City-states became empires, nation states formed in the following millennia, and United Nations have been formed less than a century ago. So although a global government might have the potential to be more authoritarian than any other type of government that has previously been known, this is not a good argument because it could also be applied against any other type of government as well before those larger scale forms of government were first created.
</p>

<p>
The intuition that bigger levels of government are more authoritarian follows from the principle that <a href="../civilization/case-against-libertarianism.html#freedom-and-population-density">more people implies more potential for conflict, and more laws to resolve said conflict</a>. But this is true only up to a point.
For every population, there is some optimal level of government for sufficiently resolving all the game-theoretic conflicts within the society of interest.
Beyond that level, it&rsquo;s mostly up to genetics (some populations are naturally more likely to defect or be corrupt than others) and the ruling government/regime as to how authoritarian the government shall be.
Small countries, like Venezuela or North Korea, can rule with an iron fist.
On the other hand, larger countries like India, Indonesia, or the United States aren&rsquo;t dictatorships and they have to grant high levels of autonomy to many of their subregions, lest they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to govern as effectively.
</p>

<p>
Aside from general corruption, higher levels of government become particularly authoritarian when they try to enforce laws that would be better resolved at lower levels of governments.

<h2 id="conclusion"><span class="section-number-2">17.</span> Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-conclusion">
<p>
There is no easy solution to the Problem of Governance because every political system is vulnerable to corruption. At the same time, government is necessary for solving game theoretic problems that occur due to human nature.
</p>

<p>
The best we can do to achieve this Pragmatopian government structure is to <a href="../epistemology/difficult-to-change-peoples-minds.html">expand rationality</a>, educate people about <a href="../epistemology/3-understanding-evolution.html">biological realism and game theory</a>, and persuade more people to realize that <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/07/what-is-morality.html">morality is an illusion</a>. If the culture won&rsquo;t accept this form of government, then there is no hope of it ever being implemented.
