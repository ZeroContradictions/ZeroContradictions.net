NOTE: I haven&rsquo;t finished writing this page.
This page doesn&rsquo;t describe everything about how a fully operational government should work.
So far, it&rsquo;s mostly just a place to write political ideas that don&rsquo;t fit into other webpages.

<h2 id="constitutional-principles"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> The Constitutional Principles Of The Government</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-constitutional-principles">
<p>
How to govern society is one of the oldest philosophical problems, and while there aren&rsquo;t always perfect solutions to every problem, there are still pragmatic and heuristic approaches that we can take.
The quest for finding an optimal government that can remain stable over long periods of time will require experimentation, trial, and error.
</p>

<h3 id="constitutions-practicality"><span class="section-number-3">1.1.</span> The Practicality of Constitutions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-constitutions-practicality">
<p>
The de facto power of the United States Constitution is weaker than the de jure power of the Constitution, but this isn&rsquo;t surprising.
At the end of the day, a Constitution is just a piece of paper created by the government to limit what the government can do.
If the government had the power to create the constitution and enforce it, then it can just as easily have the power to stop enforcing parts of it or even ignore it completely.
</p>

<figcaption><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>The approximant number of Rules for Government vs Rules for <a href="#defining-the-people">the People</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
If government has to exist, then it&rsquo;s reasonable to have a document of rules describing what the government must aim to do, as well as what it can and cannot do.
Even most anarchists have implicit rules for their societies, and they would have to have a document that explicitly states the rules of their &ldquo;societies&rdquo; if they were actually serious about their ideas.
So, it&rsquo;s still worth creating a Constitution that states the explicit rules of society and figuring out the best characteristics that a Constitution should have.
</p>

<p>
Conclusion: In order for a Constitution to have the true power and enforcement that its authors intended it to have, Constitutions must be enforced <i>directly</i> by the people instead of the government.
It cannot be stressed enough that the citizens much be vigilant to veto, rebel, and reform if the legal system ever proposes an anti-constitutional update to the legal code, lest <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/05/the-deep-state-and-myth-of-democracy.html">a deep state will form</a>.

<h3 id="government-goals"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> Political Philosophy and the Goals of Government</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-government-goals">
<p>
The foremost goal of government is to resolve problems of cooperation: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma">Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemmas</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">Tragedies of the Commons</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem">Free-Rider Problems</a>.
Government comes from the necessity to create reasonable sets of laws that will create a societal framework from which selfish individuals can cooperate together for greater mutual gain (than if they didn&rsquo;t cooperate together).
Cooperation is the foundation of civilization, and the best legal code is the one that enables that to the greatest extent possible.

<h4 id="PDs"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.2.</span> Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemmas</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-PDs">
<p>
The Societal Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma (SPD) is the most fundamental game theoretical problem that every society must solve.
Once a community of humans surpasses roughly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar&rsquo;s Number</a>, it becomes possible for humans to take advantage of others without other people being able to suspect it because not everybody knows each other.
This creates incentives for every individual to either: 1. kill, abuse, and steal from other people when it makes them better off, or 2. be bound to also kill, abuse, and steal from other people as a reaction to other people who are doing the same thing.
The resolution of the SPD requires an enforced legal code that enables cooperation.
Societies cannot exist without cooperation, and cooperation between strangers cannot exist unless the Societal Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma is solved.
</p>

<p>
In the absence of a law enforcement that would punish people for committing crimes, every person has an incentive to kill, abuse, and steal from other people because these actions make it easier to gain the resources for supporting oneself and one&rsquo;s desires, compared to if they had labored and traded with other people instead.
If only one person is defecting while everybody else is cooperating with each other, then this scenario is analogous to either of the two scenarios in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma">standard Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma</a> where one party cooperates while the other defects from the other, except that there could be any number of people cooperating and defecting at the same time.
</p>

<p>
When it&rsquo;s easy and feasible for one person to defect from cooperating with everybody else (Anarchy &amp; Lawlessness), everybody else is also incentivized to defect from everybody else too.
If this happens, then this scenario is analogous to how the two parties involved in the standard Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma are both defecting from each other, except that this defection applies to <i>everybody</i> in the area of lawlessness, not just two people.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, neither of these scenarios are desirable in comparison to a prosperous society where each person&rsquo;s labor produces wealth that is guaranteed to not be stolen or abused by other people, and where people can safely trade commodities and money to make each other better off with the guarantee that the other side will be punished if they don&rsquo;t hold up their side of the trade.
Read More: <a href="../civilization/case-against-libertarianism#ancaps-and-game-theory">Why cooperation isn&rsquo;t necessary in every person&rsquo;s best interests</a>.
</p>

<p>
The best scenario (as well as the only scenario that can create a functioning society) is when every person cooperates with each other.
In practice, this can only be achieved by a government that imposes the rule of law, which effectively eliminates every person&rsquo;s incentive to defect, since the penalties and punishments for defecting (breaking the law) are too costly and the probability of getting caught breaking the law are near ~100%.
Note that the exact probability doesn&rsquo;t matter as long as it&rsquo;s reasonably high enough to punish nearly all defectors and to discourage other from defecting.
The imposition of this law is involuntary by definition because <i>every</i> person has to abide by it whether they like it or not.
On the other hand, a &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; imposition of law would be an oxymoron because every person would disobey the voluntary law and defect in the Societal Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma when it suits their self-interests.
Law can thus only be involuntary and involuntarily imposed.
</p>


<figure id="org3db7a68">
<img src="../images/prisoners-dilemma.webp" alt="Prisoner's Dilemma Chart" width="450">

</figure>

<p>
The previously mentioned scenario comes with an important caveat that doesn&rsquo;t exist in the standard Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma.
When the government enforces the rule of law, some members of the government may choose to &ldquo;defect&rdquo; from the rest of the society by abusing their power to better achieve their self-interests.
Such is the Nature of Game Theory and the intrinsic selfishness of life.
But this is still better and more functional than an Anarchist world where literally <i>everybody</i> is defecting from each other, not just a handful of people who are in control of a strong government.
Even if the government defects from the people whose interests it&rsquo;s supposed to represent, that&rsquo;s still fewer people defecting and thus a more prosperous society, compared to the alternative (Anarchy).
How to govern society is one of the oldest philosophical problems, and while there aren&rsquo;t any ideal solutions that can completely eliminate corruption, there are some pragmatic principles and heuristics that we can follow to generate a better society.

<div id="outline-container-free-rider-problems" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="free-rider-problems"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.3.</span> Free-Rider Problems</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-free-rider-problems">
<p>
A free-rider problem is a situation where most people do the necessary contributions for making the community thrive, while a minority of people reap the benefits of the majority&rsquo;s effort while contributing nothing in return.
</p>

<p>
When a minority of a people can benefit by doing nothing, this incentivizes everybody else who is doing their part to reconsider that they could also do nothing instead, while getting the same benefits, for everybody else gains.
When this happens, the free-rider problem becomes more similar to a tragedy of the commons, but they were different initially.
</p>

<p>
Examples of Free-Rider Problems:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="../civilization/case-against-libertarianism#voluntary-self-protection">Voluntary Self-Protection</a></li>
<li><a href="../faqs/eugenics#welfare-states">Welfare States</a></li>
<li>Vaccination and Herd Immunity</li>
<li><a href="../faqs/overpopulation#overpop-game-theory">Overpopulation</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
The free rider problem partially explains why content creators and service providers that rely on donations are less likely to make money.
For example, if a private security service for monitoring one&rsquo;s home provided everybody with free security, then no one would pay for it.
Everybody would just hope that someone else pays the company with sufficient money to help the company make a profit and continue affording to provide the service.
The free rider problem thus explains why people and companies have to charge money for the value that they provide.

I am no legal expert, but if I had a better understanding of all the major differences between the world&rsquo;s legal systems, I would certainly use that knowledge to improve this post.
This map leaves me with many questions on how all the world&rsquo;s legal systems differ: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Map_of_the_Legal_systems_of_the_world_%28en%29.png">Legal Systems of the World</a>.

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Chesterton's_fence">Chesterton&rsquo;s Fence</a> is the principle that reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is understood.
For example, if the laws and legal system are dysfunctional, then it makes more sense to fix the legal system first before trying to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the court system (assuming that there are no power barriers to fixing the legal system).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-defining-the-people">
<p>
&ldquo;We the People&rdquo; is a commonly repeated phrase when talking about American history and values, but who are &ldquo;The People&rdquo; exactly?
Constitutions always say that the government must serve the people, but they never define who the &ldquo;people&rdquo; are.
For example, slaves weren&rsquo;t considered part of &ldquo;the people&rdquo; in the US until 1865, and neither were Native Americans until 1924.
Some more examples include:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Foreign-born citizens? They weren&rsquo;t sometime in the past, but now they are.</li>
<li>Men? Or men <i>and</i> women? (women didn&rsquo;t gain suffrage in Western countries until the 1900s)</li>
<li>Illegal Aliens? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_baby">Native-born children of illegal aliens</a>?</li>
<li>Confederates who declared independence and secession from the United States?</li>
<li>Mixed race people with ancestry of one of the ethnic groups of an ethnically homogenous country?</li>
<li>Citizens of very closely allied countries?</li>
</ul>
<p>
The &ldquo;people&rdquo; could even be re-framed to mean special interest groups of the country that get special privileges.
</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;ve concluded that <a href="../faqs/race#ethnostates">ethnostate</a> governments are more preferable because <a href="../faqs/eugenics#ethnostates">ethnically homogenous societies tend to have slight eugenic advantages</a>, and they <a href="../faqs/race#social-stability">tend to be more socially and politically stable</a>.
However, they aren&rsquo;t always possible, as the links explain.

Any proposed set of rights should <a href="../epistemology/axiology#what-are-values">protect and reinforce each other</a> to the maximum extent possible, rather than contradicting each other.

<p>
The relationship between a government and its citizens is traditionally called a &ldquo;social contract&rdquo;, but it shall instead be called an <b>Implicit Mutual Social Agreement (IMSA)</b> in this essay.
Every time the word &ldquo;contract&rdquo; is used, some people complain that it&rsquo;s not really a contract because they never signed it.
And while they&rsquo;re right about that, they&rsquo;re missing the point.
The idea is that if you want the benefits that society gives you, then you have to comply with society&rsquo;s rules, even if you don&rsquo;t like all the rules.
You can&rsquo;t have your cake and eat it too.
If you&rsquo;re going to break the IMSA, then society is justified to prosecute you.

</p>

<p>
When people say &ldquo;Never trust the government&rdquo; or ask &ldquo;Do you trust the government?&rdquo;, what do they even mean?
Government is very complex.
There&rsquo;s local, state, and federal levels, different branches of government, different agencies and departments of government, and many different people who all work for the government.
</p>

<p>
When conservatives say &ldquo;Never trust the government&rdquo;, they still usually trust government entities like the FDA, the USPS, local utilities, other government agencies, and probably many favored politicians.
And when libertarians and anarchists say the tagline, they typically have even less trust and approval for the government as a whole (as it currently exists) compared to conservatives, but even they will still depend on at least a few functions of government to do things that they need.
</p>

<p>
So what specifically about the government should not be trusted?
Any particular departments, agencies, or people filling administrative roles?
And generally speaking, what aspects of government can be trusted?
</p>

<p>
Also, how does one define &ldquo;trust&rdquo;?
Certainly there are different levels of trust, so what levels of trust can be applied to each component of the government?
Are there different types of trust, or are they all the same thing?

There is no easy solution to the Problem of Governance because every political system is vulnerable to corruption.
At the same time, government is necessary for solving game theoretic problems that occur due to human nature.
As a general rule, one trying to solve the problem of governance, it&rsquo;s better to have more checks and balances rather than fewer.
</p>

<p>
The best we can do to achieve this Pragmatopian government structure is to <a href="../epistemology/difficult-to-change-minds">expand rationality</a>, educate people about <a href="../epistemology/evolution">biological realism and game theory</a>, and persuade more people to realize that <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/07/what-is-morality.html">morality is an illusion</a>.
If the culture won&rsquo;t accept this form of government, then there is no hope of it ever being implemented.

<p>
Power is akin to large objects in space causing other objects to be absorbed by them, if they don&rsquo;t have enough force of their own or orbit them if they happen to produce a mutual center of gravity.
In society, power is not able to completely absorb others, for they have an individuality of their own.
But it can make others orbit around it, be dependent upon it, and act in its interests through the application of force.
</p>

<p>
In other words, to determine who rules over you, one must identify how the removal of some particular element or organizing principle would cause the system to become disorganized.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In the job market, it is the owner of the company and the supervisors.</li>
<li>In the market economy, it is money and market laws.</li>
<li>In the solar system, it is the Sun.</li>
<li>In primitive societies, it is their charismatic leader.</li>
<li>In the internet, it is people with a larger following and the infrastructure in which these people are permitted to gather following.</li>
<li>In a political movement, it is its leader in lower political organizations, or its ideology in higher political organizations.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The next task is to determine a center of gravity in our body politic.
What sort of political body causes a large portion of society to be dependent on it and become disorganized once such a center of gravity is removed?

A politician can do what&rsquo;s best for the constituents in their district, but that won&rsquo;t necessarily be what&rsquo;s best for the entire world as a whole.
For example, a local lawmaker/governor might criticize a local company for outsourcing labor that would take jobs away from their constituents (particularly in the short-term), even if that actually might be what&rsquo;s best for the entire world as a whole.
The company wins because it reduces its labor costs, the newly hired laborers overseas win because they acquire higher-paying jobs, and the community that initially lost jobs will eventually win in the long-term too (assuming that laid-off workers can find new jobs) since they can purchase cheaper goods and services.
</p>

<p>
Conceptually, this concept can be expanded to other assets too, like determining which localities gets the most government funding and infrastructure, who gets the new Fortune 500 facility, etc.
This is one reason why government often works against the people, and unfortunately it happens very often.
A more efficient government ought to not do this.
</p>

<p>
All political systems are <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kratocratic">kratocratic</a> oligarchies, regardless of how they present themselves.
Leaders of centralized systems know almost nothing about a lot of things, rather than a lot about a few things.
It&rsquo;s not possible for a single person to rule an entire country all by themselves because they need subordinates who will enforce their rule of law.
Likewise, it&rsquo;s equally impossible for a democracy to work effectively unless it has representatives and a hierarchy of other government officials.
It has to be that way, but it also creates problems with running the society.
</p>

<p>
Bureaucracies have a tendency to shift to self perpetuation over time.
There are a few things that can be done to mitigate that.
For starters, public sector unions are almost always bad since they&rsquo;re focused on promoting the interests of their workers, i.e. they&rsquo;re focused on perpetuating the bureaucracy, so perhaps they should be outlawed.
</p>

<p>
It is easier for public figures to voice opposition to bad ideas when they have no political power.
Al Gore criticized the Patriot Act, but if he had won the 2000 US presidential election, then he would have surveilled the country too by abusing governmental power, just like George W.
Bush did.
The legislation for the Patriot Act was already written up waiting for the signal.
9/11 was that signal.
As for when the Coronavirus left China, there was no legislation waiting for it since no one was expecting it.
But the spread of the virus outside of China and its over-estimated perception of deadliness was still the signal for every politician to go full tyrant.

<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dictator%27s_Handbook">The Dictator&rsquo;s Handbook</a></i> argues that one of the worst ways to fight corruption is with anti-corruption laws.
Basically, everyone is guilty because corruption is often incentivized.
More importantly, the laws will be applied in a corrupt manner, and the outcome will just be a reinforcement of the corruption that they are trying to curb.
The whole question of whether it is legitimate or not is a red herring, as we can ask who else is guilty.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Paragraph #187: On the more sophisticated level the ideology should address itself to people who are intelligent, thoughtful and rational. The object should be to create a core of people who will be opposed to the industrial system on a rational, thought-out basis, with full appreciation of the problems and ambiguities involved, and of the price that has to be paid for getting rid of the system. It is particularly important to attract people of this type, as they are capable people and will be instrumental in influencing others. These people should be addressed on as rational a level as possible. Facts should never intentionally be distorted and intemperate language should be avoided. This does not mean that no appeal can be made to the emotions, but in making such appeal care should be taken to avoid misrepresenting the truth or doing anything else that would destroy the intellectual respectability of the ideology.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph #188: On a second level, the ideology should be propagated in a simplified form that will enable the unthinking majority to see the conflict of technology vs. nature in unambiguous terms. But even on this second level the ideology should not be expressed in language that is so cheap, intemperate or irrational that it alienates people of the thoughtful and rational type. Cheap, intemperate propaganda sometimes achieves impressive short-term gains, but it will be more advantageous in the long run to keep the loyalty of a small number of intelligently committed people than to arouse the passions of an unthinking, fickle mob who will change their attitude as soon as someone comes along with a better propaganda gimmick. However, propaganda of the rabble-rousing type may be necessary when the system is nearing the point of collapse and there is a final struggle between rival ideologies to determine which will become dominant when the old world-view goes under.

<h3 id="rehabilitation"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> &ldquo;Rehabilitation&rdquo; Is A Moral Luxury And A Mistake</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-rehabilitation">
<p>
In recent years, there has been a lot of talk in Western public discourse about how governments should place a greater focus on rehabilitation instead of punishment.
However, rehabilitation should <i>not</i> be a goal of the justice system.
A justice system should punish people for crime, create the incentive to not do crime, and protect society from criminals.
Those should be the proper goals of a justice system.
Belief in rehabilitation and lenient sentencing have gotten a lot of people killed.
Examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Unterweger">Jack Unterweger</a> was a famous &ldquo;rehabilitated&rdquo; criminal, who killed many people after his release.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_James_Bulger">Jon Venables</a> is another example of someone who was sentenced too leniently.</li>
<li><a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/bronx-headless-torso-leads-murder-201500413.html">Sheldon Johnson Jr</a>&rsquo;s father, son, and family have a history of committing violent crimes. Despite this, Johnson Jr was released from prison after serving a 25-year sentence. Johnson Jr committed murder, just one month after leaving prison.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Junko_Furuta">Murder of Junko Furuta</a>: Five years after Jō Ogura finished his prison sentence, he later violently assaulted and threatened to kill an acquaintance. After Minato&rsquo;s release, he was arrested again for attempted murder after beating a 32-year-old man with a metal rod and slashing his throat with a knife.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the long-run, the most important thing that could be done for preventing crimes before they happen will be for the government to <a href="#laissez-faire-eugenostate">implement laissez-faire eugenic control of reproduction</a>.
That includes stopping criminals from reproducing.
</p>


<p>
Life imprisonment allows for the possibility to partially correct miscarriages of justice (people who were wrongly penalized can be liberated), whereas capital punishment does not.
Of course, it&rsquo;s much better to prevent crimes, than to correct them.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-corporal-punishment" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="corporal-punishment"><span class="section-number-3">3.2.</span> Corporal Punishment</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-corporal-punishment">
<p>
It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to punish taxpayers by forcing them to pay money that is used to imprison people who broke the law.
Why should a lazy criminal have their existence be funded by good, productive people who are actually contributing to society?
Imprisoning someone for several years is a detriment to everybody in society.
</p>

<p>
It can ruin the prisoner&rsquo;s life too. People cannot imagine what it&rsquo;s like to spend 5+ years in prison.
Once the prisoners finally leave the prison, how are they supposed to return to a normal lifestyle?
They could return to the outside world, but it would be completely alien to them because it wouldn&rsquo;t be the same world they had left before they were incarcerated.
Many recently released prisoners wouldn&rsquo;t even want to go back to the real world because they&rsquo;ve become so familiar with the prison world, hence why prisoners often get re-incarcerated immediately after they leave prison.
</p>

<p>
A better way to punish the criminals without wasting taxpayers&rsquo; money is to use corporal punishment instead of incarceration more often.
This way, lawbreakers are punished, and taxpayers don&rsquo;t have to pay the price for keeping the lawbreakers incarcerated.
Physical punishment works in Singapore, which has some of the lowest per capita crime rates in the world (although <a href="../faqs/race#crime-rates-gap">race</a> and economic factors undoubtedly help with this too).
The people who get punished may be unable to work for a few days while they heal from the injury and are experiencing the pain, but they&rsquo;ll quickly be able to go back to work and sustain themselves, so taxpayers won&rsquo;t have to subsidize their existence.
</p>

<p>
Western opposition to corporal punishment is only a cultural thing.
In Singapore, there&rsquo;s a sizable amount of public support for corporal punishment.
And after all, aren&rsquo;t some crimes deserving of corporal punishment, like rape, massive pyramid schemes, torturing, or severe physical abuse?
</p>

<p>
The strong desire to avoid physical punishment invokes primal instincts.
Performing it publicly could amplify its effectiveness in deterring people from committing crimes.
The combination of fear and humiliation causes corporal punishment to be both a psychological <i>and</i> a social force for deterring crime.
Being soft on crime causes crime.
And making people spend several years in prison when it&rsquo;s a very costly and ineffective punishment counts as being soft on crime.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, a prisoner could be offered assisted suicide.
Then the taxpayers don&rsquo;t have to subsidize their existence, and the prisoner would have no further opportunities to pass their genes onto the next generation.
In most cases, it would be better for everybody if people serving multiple life sentences in prison were sentenced to death instead, but the main reason why this doesn&rsquo;t happen is because it conflicts with people&rsquo;s unquestioned moral dogmas.

<h3 id="tax-evasion-procedure"><span class="section-number-3">3.3.</span> The Standard Procedure For Addressing Tax Evasion</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-tax-evasion-procedure">
<p>
This is usually what most governments do when a citizen chooses to not pay their taxes.<br>
The penalties for not paying taxes get progressively worse the longer the tax evasion persists:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If the citizen doesn&rsquo;t file their taxes, they will face a failure-to-file penalty.</li>
<li>If they file their taxes but don&rsquo;t pay up, they are charged with a failure-to-pay penalty.</li>
<li>The citizen forfeits their tax refunds.</li>
<li>The government files a notice for a federal tax lien (a claim to their property).</li>
<li>The government seizes their property.</li>
<li>The government freezes all of the citizen&rsquo;s bank accounts.</li>
<li>The citizen is charged with tax evasion.</li>
<li>The tax evader has a trial that they will probably lose, whether they show up or not.</li>
<li>An armed police officer comes to the tax evader&rsquo;s residence to arrest them and put them in jail.</li>
<li>If they try to resist, then the police officer will shoot them.</li>
</ol>
<p>
I think this is a reasonable procedure for preventing and addressing tax evasion, but there&rsquo;s still room for debating how a government should proceed with each step.
This is one of the least important debates as far as ideal governance goes, but I&rsquo;m including this section anyway because it&rsquo;s better for laws to be explicit, rather than implicit.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-drug-war">
<p>
It&rsquo;s probably better to legalize or decriminalize hard drugs, prostitution, <a href="../misc/lanzas-pedophilia-essay">and even consensual pedophilia</a>, while keeping them reasonably regulated.
Even if they&rsquo;re illegal, people will still try to do it anyway, except that it will usually be under riskier conditions and such.
These activities might arguably degenerate society, but I argue that <a href="#decriminalizing-drugs">that mainly depends on how they&rsquo;re regulated</a>.
While this section focuses on illegal drugs, a lot of it is also applicable to prostitution and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victimless_crime">victimless crimes</a>.<a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-noteref">[1]</a>

<p>
Many Western countries <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition#History">started enforcing prohibition laws in the early 1900s</a>, only for most of them to repeal them years later.
While Prohibition was motivated by good intentions, it largely failed to achieve its goals.
It also strengthened organized crime and criminal gangs, along with other negative effects.
</p>

<p>
Repealing Prohibition was thus beneficial for those countries.
Similarly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_Portugal">Portugal decriminalized all drugs in 2000</a>, and it initially worked quite successfully for accomplishing its goals.
I support decriminalizing all the currently illegal drugs, in the interests of expanding personal freedom, expanding (medical) drug research, reducing the power of drug cartels, and reducing violent crime across society.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;If you look at the drug war from a purely economic point of view, the role of the government is to protect the monopoly held by the drug cartels&rdquo; &#x2013; Milton Friedman
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
To a limited extent, this isn&rsquo;t completely true since governments also target drug cartels.
But in practice, Friedman is correct.
The government makes drug cartels possible in the first place by illegalizing drugs.

</p>

<p>
Alternatively, the state could take a heavy-handed approach towards hard drugs and enforce corporal and/or capital punishment on all drug users.
Afaik, this seems to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misuse_of_Drugs_Act_(Singapore)">work in Singapore</a>, but it&rsquo;s been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_drug_war">failure in the Phillippines</a> and would probably fail in the US as well.
</p>

<p>
To some extent, Singapore has to keep hard drugs illegal in order to maintain a public and international perception of national stability.
Singapore could legalize drugs and allow its citizens to practice them under well-regulated conditions.
However, legalizing such drugs could encourage less desirable people to immigrate to Singapore.
Many people also have stigmas against harmful and addictive drugs.
Legalizing drugs could thus potentially damage Singapore&rsquo;s international perception.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
Illegalizing drugs makes it more difficult for some responsible people to live their lives and use drugs for healthy and productive uses.
Some examples:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some people smoke marijuana to help treat epilepsy.</li>
<li>Some people who have ADHD take ADHD medications to help them focus better.</li>
<li>Some people may use psychedelic drugs for psychedelic therapy, which may help them manage anxiety and other mental disorders.</li>
</ul>
<p>
When drugs are illegal, it does of course make it easier for people to abuse drugs in ways that are harmful for themselves and for society.
But this is precisely why drugs must be well-regulated when they are legal (<a href="#decriminalizing-drugs">see the next section</a>).
A society where all drugs are legal and unregulated could potentially be worse than a society where they are illegal altogether, so it&rsquo;s not one that I endorse.

<h3 id="decriminalizing-drugs"><span class="section-number-3">3.5.</span> Decriminalizing Drugs Must Be Done Methodically</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-decriminalizing-drugs">
<p>
Any attempt to decriminalize illegal drugs must be done methodically to ensure that the intended goals are achieved without causing any unintended side effects.
Merely legalizing or decriminalizing drugs without any precautions or regulations is bound to have negative effects.
A clear example is that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUmBG1xVpuQ">Russia has huge social and cultural problems with alcohol abuse</a>, even though alcohol is legal in the country.
There are also other examples of jurisdictions where the decriminalizing or legalizing of drugs has wrought negative consequences.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As the years passed by, Portugal&rsquo;s experiment didn&rsquo;t worked perfectly because <a href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/is-portugals-drug-decriminalization-a-failure-or-success-the-answer-isnt-so-simple/">decriminalization alone wasn&rsquo;t and isn&rsquo;t a bullet-proof way to end the country&rsquo;s problems with drugs</a>.</li>
<li>Vancouver legalized all drugs in early 2023, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qwcp2mcOH0Y">it hasn&rsquo;t work out very well</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/oregon-drug-decriminalization-results-overdoses/674733/">Drug decriminalization hasn&rsquo;t worked out very well in Portland either</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We should recognize that fentanyl was the main drug used in Vancouver and Portland during their attempted reforms.
This is a likely reason why their reforms failed to have the intended effects.
Fentanyl wasn&rsquo;t popular when Portugal decriminalized all drugs in 2001, so Portugal&rsquo;s experiment may not be comparable to more recent attempts to decriminalize drugs.
</p>

<p>
These examples also suggest that there must be treatment centers, distribution systems, and oversight in place <i>before</i> any successful drug decriminalization program can be implemented.
It helps massively to issue drugs to the users in a medically controlled environment where they track and manage each user&rsquo;s medical history, while acting like a rehab center.
Illegal drug dealers and distributors should be persecuted to the fullest extent of the law, because we don&rsquo;t want to condone unregulated drug usage.
</p>

<p>
Laws and regulations are also necessary to prevent drug users from harming others and degenerating society.
A person under the influence of drugs shouldn&rsquo;t drive, people shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to do drugs in public, <a href="#adulthood-age">children shouldn&rsquo;t have access to drugs</a>, etc.
Alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana are legal in most US states, but all the states have laws regulating their usage.
Decriminalizing other drugs across jurisdictions should follow similar policies for optimal success.
</p>

<p>
Soviet Russia and the Russian Federation have tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_in_Russia">passing laws and regulations to limit alcohol consumption and its effects</a>, which had mixed success.
<a href="https://youtu.be/CXfNGcMSwzU?t=396">From what I&rsquo;ve heard</a>, further success stalled mainly because conflicts of interest have prevented further regulations from being placed on alcohol usage in Russia.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-majority-age" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="majority-age"><span class="section-number-3">4.1.</span> What Does Adulthood Imply?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-majority-age">
<p>
The age of majority ranges internationally from ages 15 to 21, with 18 being the most common age.
The reasons why 18 years of age is the world&rsquo;s social standard for defining adulthood are mainly:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Nearly all humans have finished puberty at this age [Physical Milestone]</li>
<li>Most people complete their compulsory education by 18 years of age [Mental Milestone]</li>
<li>It is the predominant legal standard that almost every country uses [Common Legal Standard]</li>
</ol>
<p>
In particular, a younger cohorts&rsquo; attainment of adulthood centers on three criteria: gaining a sense of responsibility, independent decision-making, and financial independence.
Sometimes there is the requirement of supervision by a legal guardian, or just by an adult.
Other times, there is no requirement, but rather a recommendation.
</p>

<p>
Reaching adulthood implies: 1. Having all the freedoms of an adult, and 2. the individual&rsquo;s parents no longer have a legal obligation to provide for them.
If one has all the freedoms of an adult, but their parents still have to provide for them, it can create a game-theoretical conflict if they are still living in their parents&rsquo; home under their parents&rsquo; rules.
</p>

<p>
Up until 1971, the minimum voting age in the United States was 21.
Many American adults were drafted into the ongoing Vietnam War, despite having no say in whether the war should be fought at all.
In response, the US Congress passed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-sixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">26th amendment</a>.
The justification was that men being drafted should have the right to vote.
While the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Minimum_Drinking_Age_Act">the drinking age was raised from 18 to 21 in 1984</a>.

<h3 id="merit-adulthood-age"><span class="section-number-3">4.2.</span> Why The Age Of Adulthood Should Be Determined By Merit</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-merit-adulthood-age">
<p>
To a great extent, the concept of adulthood is a social construction instead of a biological one.
People start to do actions associated with adulthood at different ages.
This suggests that it would be more appropriate to use an age range or a tier system for bestowing rights, instead of a static age.
These tiers could be set by age levels and/or by individual merit.
</p>

<p>
Completing secondary education is probably be the greatest merit and accomplishment for reaching full adulthood.
At the end of the day, adulthood should be determined based on whatever works best for the society.
Children are also a lifelong commitment and investment, not something to be disregarded after 18 years or whatever the age or designation for legal adulthood happens to be.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Most women and some men complete puberty at 16 years old, and most men complete puberty at 17 years old, although this does vary by person and race.</li>
<li>Most people are able to reproduce before completing puberty, which suggests an even lower age.</li>
<li>Teenagers have decent reasoning skills to make their own personal decisions.</li>
<li>If people become adults and complete their secondary education at an earlier age, then that gives them a few additional years to live their lives however they want, independently of their parents.</li>
<li>If <a href="#education-system">better education</a> and a more intellectual culture were available, people could probably learn the same material in considerably less time than 13 years.</li>
<li>If children don&rsquo;t like their guardians or environment, then they can leave their mediocre or suboptimal situation a few years earlier by becoming a legal adult.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="../epistemology/determinism#parents-children">Humans have no control to determine who the parents/guardians that will raise them are</a>.</li>
<li>Why should we restrict their freedom, if they are able to become self-sufficient at a younger age?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If people are told that they are adults and that they are responsible for their own actions, then many people will psychologically believe that they are adults and act like adults.</li>
<li>The idea that <a href="../images/brain-development-finishes-at-25-is-myth.jpg">average human brain development takes 25 years is mostly a myth</a>.
The ability to make rational decisions regarding one&rsquo;s life should be the true metric for adulthood, not brain development.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People don&rsquo;t need to be 25 years old to make important life decisions, especially if they are rational and have a comprehensive education.</li>
<li>The executive function of the human brain <a href="../images/brain-development-finishes-at-25-is-myth.jpg">tends to plateau by 16 years old</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<p>
If a teenager can get a job, drive a car, manage their own finances, complete puberty, date people, and finish high school (under a better education system), then they should be granted the same liberties that an 18-year-old has.

</p>

<p>
The only acceptable taxes are the ones that don&rsquo;t punish productivity.
There would be three main sources of revenue for the government:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="../civilization/georgism-crash-course#clarifying-NRT">Natural Resource Taxes</a> (taxed at the point of extraction)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Land Value Taxes
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Location Value Taxes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pollution Taxes (taxed at the point of pollution)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="../civilization/georgism-and-population-control">Reproduction Taxes</a> (the price for buying a reproduction license)</li>
<li><a href="../faqs/demurrage">Currency Taxes</a> (for hoarding money).</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_currency">Currency Hoarding Taxes</a>.</li>
<li>Head Taxes (a fixed amount per person)</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p>
Natural Resources (oil, coal, iron, natural gas, stocks of fish, etc) will be taxed at the point of extraction, while taxes will be collected from the title owners of the land possessors.
This will encourage land and resources to be used more efficiently and solve a tragedy of the commons with respect to land and natural resources.
</p>

<p>
If natural resource taxation takes into account what the businesses and other buyers want to create with the natural resources, then it would make sense to enforce a tax that applies specifically to excessively large vehicles, just like how it <a href="../images/japanese-trucks-vs-american-trucks.png">causes Japanese trucks to be smaller and more fuel efficient than American trucks</a>.
This could be done by taxing the weight, volume, and size of said vehicles.
Another point is that excessively luxurious items like cruise ships and such would also be subject to an appropriate amount of taxation, since it would reduce the resource intensiveness of those products.
Similarly, water should be priced in tiers, so that usage beyond basic need is prohibitively expensive.
Golf isn&rsquo;t the only industry abusing water usage.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
Currency hoarding taxes are justified, <a href="../faqs/demurrage#pigouvian-tax">according to Pigouvian principles</a>.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
The purpose of head taxes is to ensure that everyone who uses government services pays for receiving the benefits of society.
If people who buy natural resources or possess land were the only ones paying taxes, then that cause one of two problems:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There would be a <a href="#free-rider-problems">free-rider problem</a> where people gain the benefits of government, but don&rsquo;t have to pay for any of them.</li>
<li>It could potentially give corporations and land possessors too much influence over the government since they are the only ones funding the government.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Head taxes help prevent both of these potential problems.
</p>


<hr>
<p>
Unless there&rsquo;s a balanced budget amendment, there is no evidence that cutting taxes incentivizes governments to spend less.
The so-called &ldquo;Starve the Beast&rdquo; theory doesn&rsquo;t work.
Whenever the US government has cut taxes in the last few decades, government spending continued to increase.

You can&rsquo;t tax inheritance without taxing gifts, and you can&rsquo;t tax gifts without taxing income.

There are lots of ideas that would not be geopolitically stable, and yet people think they&rsquo;re immoral anyway.
A realist couldn&rsquo;t care less if people think that measures that ensure geopolitical stability are &ldquo;immoral&rdquo;.
Some examples include the selective service system, the illegality of secession, the need to maintain a strong global military presence, etc, which are all necessary for geopolitical stability.
If the alternative is geopolitical instability, then those moralistic ideas are not worth any consideration because they would lead to war, conflict, and the country&rsquo;s downfall.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-public-healthcare-skepticism">
<div class="opponent" id="orgc8a374e">
<p>
A public healthcare system could make the general population healthier on average.
</p>

</div>
<p>
This ignores how a public healthcare system would subsidize people who don&rsquo;t take care of their health.
It&rsquo;s not possible to subsidize <i>every</i> demographic within an economy.
Hence, healthy people would have to be taxed in order to subsidize unhealthy people.
Subsidizing is redistribution basically.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, a public healthcare system would increase the dysgenics of the population.
As mentioned in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recent_human_evolution#Early_Modern_Period_to_present">this Wikipedia article on Recent Human Evolution</a>, people who smoke tend to have fewer children since smokers have shorter lifespans.
By providing healthcare to smokers and other people with unhealthy lifestyles, we are helping their undesirable genes stay in the gene pool by greatly reducing that selectionary pressure on the population, and that certainly isn&rsquo;t good for society in the long-term.
</p>

<p>
If we&rsquo;re focused on achieving a society that will last thousands or tens of thousands of years or so, then it would be better if the people who live the unhealthy lifestyles die off naturally via natural selection.
In the long term, that would result in a much healthier population where healthy people don&rsquo;t have to subsidize unhealthy lifestyles.

<li>Eliminate all price caps and price controls, so that the long-term supply equilibrium is met, thus stabilizing costs?</li>
<li>Require everyone to be automatically registered as an organ donor, by default.
People can opt of this act, but doing so will place them at the very bottom of the organ priority list, should they need an organ transplant to save their life.

</ul>
<p>
Arguably, the best thing that could lower the cost of healthcare would be to encourage people to adopt healthier lifestyles and healthier diets.
If people are healthier, then they will need less healthcare.
If the demand for healthcare goes down, then the cost of healthcare also goes down.
This is true regardless of whatever healthcare system a country uses.
The main caveat is that it requires changing the country&rsquo;s culture, people&rsquo;s personal will to do lifestyle changes, and educating/persuading everyone on a case-by-case basis.

<p>
There will be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_voucher">voucher system</a> for guaranteeing some standard set of education
This will be similar to health insurance in the United States where healthcare is provided by private companies, but there will be a public safety net for everybody else.
Parents who don&rsquo;t want to enroll their children into the public education system would not have to pay taxes to fund it, and would only have to pay for their children&rsquo;s private education expenses.
</p>

<p>
There may even be a public education system that people can opt out of, but I&rsquo;m undecided on this.
It has the advantage of creating a government-provided safety net for education.
Public education can have a unifying effect on the collective values of society, which helps reduce the variance of the society&rsquo;s values.
In a society, you want to distribute the risks of life among everybody, hence why safety nets on a collective level are a good idea.
On the other hand, most current public schools seem to demonstrate inefficiency.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_college">for-profit colleges</a> tend to be some of the worst colleges anyone could choose.
It&rsquo;s true that Ancaps and Libertarians also support private non-profit colleges (which are among the best colleges, i.e. the Ivy League).
Nonetheless, this is a great example of why it&rsquo;s unreasonable to replace all government services with private corporations.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-global-government-structure">
<p>
Global government is important for equally distributing countries&rsquo; natural resources.
It is tremendously unfair that the citizens in countries with abundant natural resources in proportion to their populations (e.g. Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, etc) get to have their lives subsidized by the government&rsquo;s ability to sell the abundant natural resources that are present on their lands, instead of having those natural resources be own equally by the entire world&rsquo;s population and managed by a global government.
This contributes to increasing the dysgenics of the world&rsquo;s population.

<h4 id="why-global-government"><span class="section-number-4">6.3.1.</span> Why should there be a global government? Can&rsquo;t nation-state governments suffice?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-why-global-government">
<p>
Global government is <i>necessary</i> in order to resolve critical game theoretical problems on a global scale.
Solving game-theoretic problems is exactly what a government is supposed to do, and a global government simply does that a global scale.
Some examples of game-theoretic problems that are best resolved by global government are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Overpopulation</li>
<li>Global warming and carbon emissions</li>
<li>Enforcing Georgism and the conservation of the Earth&rsquo;s natural resources</li>
<li>Regulating the pollution done by each country</li>
<li>Preventing wars to the fullest extent possible (wars could potentially destroy modern civilization)</li>
<li>Resolving geopolitical conflicts in order to ensure geopolitical stability</li>
<li>Et Cetera</li>

<div id="outline-container-global-government-responsiveness" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="global-government-responsiveness"><span class="section-number-4">6.3.2.</span> But aren&rsquo;t smaller-scale governments more responsive and representative?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-global-government-responsiveness">
<p>
It depends on the situation.
But even if this premise is true, it doesn&rsquo;t refute the fact that a global government is still <i>necessary</i> in order to resolve critical game theoretical problems on a global scale, lest everyone on Earth shall face potentially catastrophic consequences.
</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;re going to have some type of de facto global power structure no matter what happens.
Today, that is currently the United Nations, combined with the influence of the Chinese and American superpowers, and other international organizations.
An explicit, limited government is better than a hidden web of power, or a balance of power between hostile societies.
</p>

<p>
Also, moving problems somewhere else doesn&rsquo;t accomplish anything.
If nation-state governments are less effective for solving a game-theoretic problem instead of a global government, then a global government should take care of the problem instead.

<div id="outline-container-government-levels-authoritarianism" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="government-levels-authoritarianism"><span class="section-number-4">6.3.3.</span> Aren&rsquo;t higher levels of government more authoritarian?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-government-levels-authoritarianism">
<p>
Maybe, but the same could be said about literally any scale of government.
Local governments can be extremely authoritarian, state governments can be extremely authoritarian, national governments can be extremely authoritarian, etc.
The key thing to notice here is that even though it&rsquo;s obvious that bigger governments have the power to be authoritarian on a greater scale than smaller governments, it still made more sense to build higher and higher levels of government throughout the history of Humanity.
City-states became empires, nation states formed in the following millennia, and United Nations have been formed less than a century ago.
So although a global government might have the potential to be more authoritarian than any other type of government that has previously been known, this is not a good argument because it could also be applied against any other type of government as well before those larger scale forms of government were first created.
</p>

<p>
The intuition that bigger levels of government are more authoritarian follows from the principle that <a href="../civilization/case-against-libertarianism#freedom-and-population-density">more people implies more potential for conflict, and more laws to resolve said conflict</a>.
But this is true only up to a point.
For every population, there is some optimal level of government for sufficiently resolving all the game-theoretic conflicts within the society of interest.
Beyond that level, it&rsquo;s mostly up to genetics (some populations are naturally more likely to defect or be corrupt than others) and the ruling government/regime as to how authoritarian the government shall be.
Small countries, like Venezuela or North Korea, can rule with an iron fist.
On the other hand, larger countries like India, Indonesia, or the United States aren&rsquo;t dictatorships and they have to grant high levels of autonomy to many of their subregions, lest they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to govern as effectively.
</p>

<p>
Aside from general corruption, higher levels of government become particularly authoritarian when they try to enforce laws that would be better resolved at lower levels of governments.
</p>

<p>
And although it&rsquo;s true that <a href="../civilization/case-against-libertarianism#freedom-and-population-density">higher population densities necessarily lead to more constraints on individual freedom</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL066i9HoWE">it&rsquo;s not true that countries with enormous populations like China have to be excessively authoritarian</a>.
If China (and Chinese culture) is naturally authoritarian, then how do you explain the Xinhai Revolution, the democratization of Taiwan, and the Hong Kong protests?
Or how Japan, South Korea, and Singapore are also non-authoritarian, while having populations whose genetics are quite similar to the Han Chinese people?
