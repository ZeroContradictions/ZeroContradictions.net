<h2 id="prerequisites-for-understanding-this-political-philosophy"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Prerequisites For Understanding This Political Philosophy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-prerequisites-for-understanding-this-political-philosophy">
<p>
If you want to understand this political and ethical philosophy, the best way to start would be to read the book and <a href="../index.html#bio-realism">all the essays listed on this section of the website</a>.
</p>

<p>
This political philosophy is based on understanding the implications that evolutionary theory has for the human race and human societies. Humans are a biological species, so they cannot be understood without a very firm understanding of biology.
</p>

<p>
Some people may say that this is a very autistic way of viewing humanity, but it has the explanatory and predictive power that every other worldview doesn&rsquo;t have, so it&rsquo;s the best one.

<h2 id="constitutional-principles"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> The Constitutional Principles Of The Government</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-constitutional-principles">
<p>
How to govern society is one of the oldest philosophical problems, and we don&rsquo;t have any ideal solution, just some pragmatic and heuristic ones.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-practicality-of-constitutions" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="practicality-of-constitutions"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> The Practicality of Constitutions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-practicality-of-constitutions">
<p>
The de facto power of the United States Constitution is weaker than the de jure power of the Constitution, but this isn&rsquo;t really surprising. At the end of the day, a Constitution is just a piece of paper created by the government to limit what the government can do. So if the government had the power to create the constitution and enforce it, then it can just as easily have the power to stop enforcing parts of it or even ignore it completely.
</p>

<p>
But if government is going to exist, it definitely wouldn&rsquo;t be unreasonable to have a document of rules describing what the government must aim to do, as well as what it can and cannot do. Even most anarchists have implicit rules for their societies, and they would have to have a document that explicitly states the rules of their &ldquo;societies&rdquo; if they were actually serious about their ideas. That said, it&rsquo;s still worth creating a Constitution that states the explicit rules of society and figuring out the best characteristics that a Constitution should have.
</p>

<p>
Conclusion: In order for a Constitution to have the true power and enforcement that its authors intended it to have, Constitutions must be enforced <b>directly</b> by the people instead of the government. It cannot be stressed enough that the citizens much be vigilant to veto, rebel, and reform if the legal system ever proposes an anti-constitutional update to the legal code, lest <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/05/the-deep-state-and-myth-of-democracy.html?view=classic">a deep state will form</a>. However, I&rsquo;m not entirely sure how such a society could be structured to make this more likely or even guaranteed to happen, if it&rsquo;s even possible.

<div id="outline-container-goals-of-government" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="goals-of-government"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Political Philosophy And The Goals Of Government</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-goals-of-government">
<p>
The first and foremost goal of government is to resolve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma">Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemmas</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">Tragedies of the Commons</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem">Free-Rider Problems</a>. Government comes from the necessity to create a reasonable set of laws that would create a societal framework from which selfish individuals can cooperate together for greater mutual gain (than if they didn&rsquo;t cooperate together). Cooperation is the foundation of civilization, and the best legal code is the one that enables that to the greatest extent possible.
</p>

<p>
Instead of calling the relationship between a citizen and the government a &ldquo;social contract&rdquo;, it shall instead be called an <b>Implicit Mutual Social Agreement (IMSA)</b>. Every time the word &ldquo;contract&rdquo; is used, Libertarians and Ancaps complain that it&rsquo;s not really a contract because they never signed it. And while they&rsquo;re right about that, they&rsquo;re missing the point. The idea is that if you want the benefits that society gives you, then you have to comply with society&rsquo;s rules, even if you don&rsquo;t like all the rules. You can&rsquo;t have your cake and eat it too. If you&rsquo;re going to break the IMSA, then society is justified to prosecute you.

I am no legal expert, but if I had a better (and preferably concise) understanding of all the major differences between the world&rsquo;s legal systems, I would certainly use that knowledge to improve this post. This map leaves me with many questions on how all the world&rsquo;s legal systems differ: <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Map_of_the_Legal_systems_of_the_world_%28en%29.png">Legal Systems of the World</a>

<h3 id="geopolitical-stability"><span class="section-number-3">2.5.</span> Geopolitical Stability</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-geopolitical-stability">
<p>
Any proposal must be geopolitically stable. A network of city states would fail since it wouldn&rsquo;t be geopolitically stable, so it is not viable.
</p>

<p>
There are lots of ideas that would not be geopolitically stable, and yet people think they&rsquo;re immoral anyway.
    I couldn&rsquo;t care less if people think that measures that ensure geopolitical stability are &ldquo;immoral&rdquo; (e.g. the selective service system, not allowing secession, maintaining a strong global military presence, etc).
    If the alternative is geopolitically instability, then those moralistic ideas are not worth any consideration because they would enable war, conflict, and the country&rsquo;s downfall.()
</p>

<p>
Private cities are similar in concept to the nation-states that exist today, except that nation-states are bigger, authoritarian by default, and are characterized by local geography, socio-ethnolinguistic groups, history, cultures, etc. If one doesn&rsquo;t like the country that they are currently living in, they (usually) have a choice to leave and migrate to another.

It&rsquo;d be nice if we could have a society that fixes problems <i>before</i> they happen, instead of <i>after</i> they happen, but most people are only inclined to do the latter since most people are low-IQ and the former requires thinking on a much higher level. We live in a <a href="../epistemology/free-will.html">determinsitic cause-and-effect universe</a>, and since people have selective attentions, they tend to only focus on things <i>after</i> they happen since there has to be something that causes them to think about those problems in the first place.

</p>

<p>
When people say &ldquo;Never trust the government&rdquo; or ask &ldquo;Do you trust the government?&rdquo;, what do either of those even mean? Government is very complex, there&rsquo;s local, state, and federal levels, different branches of government, different agencies and departments of government, and many different people who all work for the government.
</p>

<p>
When conservatives say &ldquo;Never trust the government&rdquo;, they will still usually trust government entities like the FDA, the USPS, local utilities, other government agencies, and probably many favored politicians. And when anarchists or libertarians say the tagline, they typically have even less trust and approval for the government as a whole (as it currently exists) compared to conservatives, but even they will probably still count on at least a few functions of government to do things that they depend on.
</p>

<p>
So what specifically about the government should not be trusted? Any particular departments, agencies, or people filling administrative roles? And generally speaking, what aspects of government can be trusted?
</p>

<p>
Also, how does one define &ldquo;trust&rdquo;? Certainly there are different levels of trust, so what levels of trust can be applied to each component of the government? Are there different types of trust, or are they all the same thing?

A politician can do what&rsquo;s best for the constituents in their district, but that won&rsquo;t necessarily be what&rsquo;s best for the entire world as a whole. For example, a local lawmaker/governor might criticize a local company for outsourcing labor since that would take jobs away from their constituents (particularly in the short-term), even if that actually might be what&rsquo;s best for the entire world as a whole. The company wins because it reduces its labor costs, the newly hired laborers overseas win because they acquire higher-paying jobs, and the community that initially lost jobs eventually will win in the long-term too (assuming that laid-off workers can find new jobs) since they can purchase cheaper goods and services. Conceptually, this concept can be expanded to other assets too, like determining who gets the most government funding and infrastructure, who gets the new Fortune 500 facility, etc. This is one reason why government often works against the people, and unfortunately it happens very often. A more efficient government/reason-system ought to not do this.
</p>

<p>
Leaders of centralized systems know almost nothing about a lot of things, rather than a lot about a few things. It has to be that way, but it also creates problems with running the society.
</p>

<p>
All political systems are oligarchies, regardless of how they present themselves. It&rsquo;s not possible for a single person to rule an entire country all by themselves because they need subordinates who will enforce their rule of law, and it&rsquo;s equally impossible for a democracy to work effectively unless it is a representatives and a hierarchy of other government officials.
</p>

<p>
Bureaucracies have a tendency to shift to self perpetuation over time. There are a few things that can be done to mitigate that. For starters, public sector unions are almost always bad, since they&rsquo;re focused on promoting the interests of their workers, i.e. they&rsquo;re focused on perpetuating the bureaucracy, so perhaps they should be outlawed. Furthermore, we should &#x2026;
</p>

<p>
It is very easy to voice opposition to things when out of power. If Al Gore had won the 2000 US presidential election, then he would have surveilled the country too by abusing governmental power rather than just using terrorism as an excuse to go somewhat further like Bush did. The legislation for the Patriot Act was already written up waiting for the signal. 9/11 was that signal. As for when the Coronavirus left China, there was no legislation waiting for it since no one was expecting it. But the spread of the virus outside of China and its over-estimated perception of deadliness was still the signal for every politician to go full tyrant.

<a href="../misc/industrial-society-and-its-future-manifesto.html#strategy">From Industrial Society And Its Future</a> by Dr. Ted Kaczynski:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Paragraph #187: On the more sophisticated level the ideology should address itself to people who are intelligent, thoughtful and rational. The object should be to create a core of people who will be opposed to the industrial system on a rational, thought-out basis, with full appreciation of the problems and ambiguities involved, and of the price that has to be paid for getting rid of the system. It is particularly important to attract people of this type, as they are capable people and will be instrumental in influencing others. These people should be addressed on as rational a level as possible. Facts should never intentionally be distorted and intemperate language should be avoided. This does not mean that no appeal can be made to the emotions, but in making such appeal care should be taken to avoid misrepresenting the truth or doing anything else that would destroy the intellectual respectability of the ideology.
</p>

<p>
Paragraph #188: On a second level, the ideology should be propagated in a simplified form that will enable the unthinking majority to see the conflict of technology vs. nature in unambiguous terms. But even on this second level the ideology should not be expressed in language that is so cheap, intemperate or irrational that it alienates people of the thoughtful and rational type. Cheap, intemperate propaganda sometimes achieves impressive short-term gains, but it will be more advantageous in the long run to keep the loyalty of a small number of intelligently committed people than to arouse the passions of an unthinking, fickle mob who will change their attitude as soon as someone comes along with a better propaganda gimmick. However, propaganda of the rabble-rousing type may be necessary when the system is nearing the point of collapse and there is a final struggle between rival ideologies to determine which will become dominant when the old world-view goes under.

<li>When many liberal democracies offer voters yes/no propositions to vote for on a city, state, or national level, this is rather similar to the 2/3 direct democratic veto that I am proposing as a check on the reason system.</li>
<li>Among eligible participating voters, if for every person who does not disapprove of the legislation, there are two people who disapprove, then the legislation is vetoed. Although a skeptic might argue that percentages are arbitrary, two-thirds (or approximately 66.66%) is the lowest majority ratio that is higher than 50% (or half of the population) AND only uses integers.</li>

<h3 id="corporal-punishment-and-humiliation"><span class="section-number-3">7.1.</span> Why Corporal Punishment And Humiliation Are More Practical Punishments Than Making Prisoners Spend Years In Prison</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-corporal-punishment-and-humiliation">
<p>
It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to punish taxpayers by forcing them to pay money that is used to imprison people who broke the law. Why should a person who is lazy and committed crimes have their existence funded by good laboring people who are actually contributing to society? A better method of punish the lawbreakers without wasting taxpayers&rsquo; money.
</p>

<p>
Instead, I propose that corporal punishment should be used instead of prison sentences. This way, lawbreakers are punished, and taxpayers don&rsquo;t have to pay the price for keeping the lawbreakers locked up in prison. Physical punishment works in Singapore, and Singapore has some of the lowest per capita crime rates in the world (although race and economic factors undoubtedly help with this too). The people who get punished may be unable to work for a few days while they heal from the injury and are experiencing the pain, but then they have to go back to work, and taxpayers won&rsquo;t have to subsidize their existence.
</p>


<p>
Western opposition to corporal punishment is just a cultural thing. In Singapore, there is at least a sizable amount of public support for corporal punishment. And after all, aren&rsquo;t some crimes deserving of corporal punishment, like rape, massive pyramid schemes, torturing, or severe physical abuse? And if corporal punishment does help deter crime, how could the extent to which it does be proven? Couldn&rsquo;t Singapore&rsquo;s lower crime rates also be attributed to its strong economic conditions as well?
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">People cannot imagine what it&rsquo;s like to spend 5 years in prison.</span> Especially if it&rsquo;s often far longer than that, it completely ruins someone&rsquo;s life. People cannot intuitively understand how bad that is. And once the prisoners finally leave the prison, how are they supposed to get back into the real world and return to a normal lifestyle? They could go back to the outside world, but it would be completely alien to them because everybody would be changed and different. Imprisoning someone for several years is a detriment to everybody in society, including hardworking taxpayers who have to pay for the imprisonment. Some wouldn&rsquo;t even want to go back out into the real world because they&rsquo;ve become so familiar with the prison world, hence why people often get re-incarcerated immediately after they leave prison.
</p>

<p>
Another big factor that could change or possibly improve the effects of physical punishment could be to have it be done publicly. Being caned in the townsquare for everybody to see the person deserving the punishment would be a way to humiliate them, so instead of being a purely psychological force for discouraging/preventing crime, it could also be turned into a social force, possibly even a eugenic force if we consider the following scenario. If someone is seen by the public being punished, then fewer people would work with them, and thus they would make less money, and thus they would have fewer children.
</p>

<p>
<span class="underline">Physical punishment also invokes primal instincts,</span> which could very strongly increase its effectiveness and people&rsquo;s willingness to avoid it as much as possible. If the brain can be roughly divided into about three parts, then the fear of corporal punishment and strong desire to avoid it works off the most basic structures within the human brain. Both of these proposed punishments are based on incentives, and utilize both psychological and economic principles. Being soft on crime causes crime. And making people spend several years in prison when it&rsquo;s a very costly and ineffective punishment counts as being soft on crime.
</p>

<p>
Or alternatively, a prisoner could be offered assisted suicide. Then the taxpayers don&rsquo;t have to subsidize their existence, and the prisoner then has no further opportunities to pass their genes onto the next generation. In most cases, it would just be better for everybody if people serving multiple life sentences in prison were just sentenced to death instead, but the main reason why this doesn&rsquo;t happen is due to people&rsquo;s moral dogmas.

As concluded by the videos above, a portion of the government revenue would be set aside to provide monetary awards and official recognition to anybody who manages to create a major innovation and document it.
</p>

<p>
The branch of government that is responsible for describing problems to be solved for monetary rewards and distributing the rewards to the winners would also provide rewards for people who solve major mathematical and/or scientific problems. Currently, for many unsolved mathematical problems, there are no monetary rewards for completing them, but providing rewards could incentivize more people to attempt completing them.

In order to prevent war, disease, and famine, there must be a maximum population limit enforced for the country&rsquo;s total number of citizens. In order to enforce that population limit, anybody who wants to have children must acquire a Reproduction License for each child that they want to have. Everybody else who is unauthorized to have (more) children must have mandatory contraception, since that is the only way to ensure that people do not create legally unauthorized offspring, and thus the only way to avoid the truly devastating consequences of overpopulation.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-EPC-enforcement">
<p>
There are various ways to do it, but ultimately, the enforcement of the EPC system will depend on how <a href="../FAQs/EPC-FAQs.html#not-authoritarian">&ldquo;authoritarian&rdquo;</a> the government has to be in order to enforce the Law. This section will explain all the various measures the government could do, if necessary. Note that it is extraordinarily improbable that all of these measures would have to be used, which is a good thing since we want to do this in the most compassionate and least authoritarian way possible.
</p>

<p>
Ideally, the population would be compliant and none of the more drastic measures would be necessary. But if the measures are necessary, we still view them as being more favorable than having to deal with the horrendous consequences of overpopulation, <a href="../overpopulation-FAQs.html#malthusianism-cornucopniasm">when it eventually happens</a>.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-most-likely-enforcement">
<p>
The government will start with the least authoritarian and least invasive methods for enforcing population control, and if those methods for enforcing the law, then they will be the status quo. It will be a felony for anyone to have children without a reproduction license, so there will already be strong incentives for people to comply with the law. If unlicensed children are born, but the parents would still be responsible for paying for the child&rsquo;s existence, and paying back society for the incurred costs. This could be done by fining the parents at a fee that is 50% higher than the cost of a reproduction license. If they are unable to pay that, then they will be placed in a debtor&rsquo;s prison until they pay off their debt to society. They will also be monitored with regular birth control testing to ensure that they don&rsquo;t break the law again.

<p>
There will be a public education system and a voucher system, similar to health insurance in the United States, where healthcare is provided by private companies, but there is a public safety net for everybody else. Parents who don&rsquo;t want to enroll their children into the public education system would not have to pay taxes to fund it, and would only have to pay for their children&rsquo;s private education expenses.
</p>

<p>
This free-market approach would provide private education companies with equal opportunity, but also
</p>

<p>
There&rsquo;s a good argument for a government-provided safety net for education. Public education can have a unifying effect on the collective values of society, which helps reduce the variance of the society&rsquo;s values.
In a society, you want to distribute the risks of life among everybody, and that&rsquo;s why safety nets on a collective level are a good idea.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-public-healthcare-skepticism">
<p>
It can be argued that a public healthcare system could make the general population healthier on average, but this ignores the fact that a public healthcare system would subsidize people who don&rsquo;t take care of their health, meaning that healthy people would have to pay the cost of that since it&rsquo;s not possible to subsidize every demographic within an economy (subsidizing is redistribution basically).
</p>

<p>
Moreover, a public healthcare system would increase the dysgenics of the population. As mentioned in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recent_human_evolution#Early_Modern_Period_to_present">this Wikipedia article on Recent Human Evolution</a>, people who smoke tend to have fewer children since smokers have shorter lifespans. By providing healthcare to smokers and other people with unhealthy lifestyles, you are helping their undesirable genes stay in the gene pool by greatly reducing that selectionary pressure on the population, and that certainly isn&rsquo;t good for society in the long-term. If we&rsquo;re focused on achieving a society that will last thousands or tens of thousands of years or so, then it would be better if the people who live the unhealthy lifestyles die off naturally via natural selection. In the long term, that would result in a much healthier population where healthy people don&rsquo;t have to subsidize unhealthy lifestyles.

Global government is important for equally distributing countries&rsquo; natural resources. It is tremendously unfair that the citizens in countries with abundant natural resources in proportion to their populations (e.g. Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, etc) get to have their lives subsidized by the government&rsquo;s ability to sell the abundant natural resources that are present on their lands, instead of having those natural resources be own equally by the entire world&rsquo;s population and managed by a global government.

<div id="outline-container-why-global-government" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="why-global-government"><span class="section-number-4">17.3.1.</span> Why should there be a global government? Can&rsquo;t nation-state governments suffice?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-why-global-government">
<p>
Because global government is <i>necessary</i> in order to resolve critical game theoretical problems on a global scale. Solving game-theoretic problems is exactly what a government is supposed to do, so a global government simply does that a global scale. Some examples of game-theoretic problems that are best resolved by global government are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>overpopulation</li>
<li>global warming and carbon emissions</li>
<li>enforcing Georgism and the conservation of the Earth&rsquo;s natural resources</li>
<li>regulating the pollution done by each country</li>
<li>preventing wars to the fullest extent possible (wars could potentially destroy modern civilization)</li>
<li>resolving geopolitical conflicts in order to ensure geopolitical stability</li>
<li>Et Cetera</li>
</ul>
<p>
Also, if we don&rsquo;t build a global government, a de facto global government will take form instead. Today, that is currently the United Nations, combined with the influence of the Chinese and American superpowers. So we might as well build a global government that is less likely to be a dumpster fire like the UN.

<div id="outline-container-global-government-responsiveness" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="global-government-responsiveness"><span class="section-number-4">17.3.2.</span> But aren&rsquo;t smaller-scale governments more responsive and representative?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-global-government-responsiveness">
<p>
It depends on the situation. But even if this question is true, it doesn&rsquo;t refute the fact that a global government is still <i>necessary</i> in order to resolve critical game theoretical problems on a global scale, lest you and everybody else on Earth face potentially catastrophic consequences. Even if you are insistent that there should be no global government, a de facto government will arise instead. The current de facto global government consists of the UN, the United States&rsquo;s power and influence, China&rsquo;s power and influence, and other international organizations. It would be better to burn the UN to the ground and organize a new global government that would be more apt at regulating and resolving conflicts between the world&rsquo;s nation-states.
</p>

<p>
Also, moving problems somewhere else doesn&rsquo;t accomplish anything. If nation-state governments would be less effective for solving a game-theoretic problem instead of a global government, then a global government should take care of the problem instead.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-global-government-authoritarianism" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="global-government-authoritarianism"><span class="section-number-4">17.3.3.</span> Wouldn&rsquo;t a global government be extremely authoritarian?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-global-government-authoritarianism">
<p>
Maybe, but the same could be said about literally any scale of government. Local governments can be extremely authoritarian, state governments can be extremely authoritarian, national governments can be extremely authoritarian, etc. But the key thing to notice here is that even though it&rsquo;s obvious that bigger governments have the power to be authoritarian on a greater scale than smaller governments, that hasn&rsquo;t refuted why it has made sense to build bigger levels of government throughout the history of Humanity, otherwise Nation-States never would&rsquo;ve formed, nor would the United Nations have been formed less than a century ago. So although a global government might have the potential to be more authoritarian than any other type of government that has previously been known, this is not a good argument because it could also be applied against any other type of government as well before those larger scale forms of government were first created.
