<p>
The best way to challenge our beliefs is to debate them with other people and put our ideas to the test.
I enjoyed reading T. K. Van Allen&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPXKWDVC">Futurist Fantasies</a></i>, and I believe it made a strong case for why space colonization is highly unlikely.
It&rsquo;s a great book, but there&rsquo;s also a lot that can be added to it, particularly regarding technologies and ideas that it had not considered.
My intention in writing this webpage is to further determine what humanity may be capable of, with greater accuracy.

<h2 id="megastructures"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Megastructures And Steel</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-megastructures">
<p>
The Megastructures chapter mainly focuses on the strength and weight of steel.
Most futurists are aware that steel would be very heavy and possibly not strong enough for building space travel infrastructure.
This is a list of materials that humanity could <i>hypothetically</i> use for megastructures instead of steel:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Carbon Fiber / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_nanotube">Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs)</a></li>
<li>Kevlar</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpiDADw5Omw">Fire Ants?</a>; Note that fire ants need oxygen, food, water, radiation shielding to survive.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Notes about building space travel infrastructure:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The book concludes that space elevators, mass drivers, and orbital rings are all probably unfeasible for space launching infrastructure.
I don&rsquo;t know much about mass drivers, but so far, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_50TM3OeEw">they have been successful with launching 200kg objects</a>.</li>
<li>The book also doesn&rsquo;t discuss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyhook_(structure)">skyhooks/spacehooks</a>, but they may be a viable solution for building infrastructure for both space flight ascent <i>and</i> descent.
Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqwpQarrDwk">1,000km Cable to the Stars: The Skyhook - Kurzgesagt</a>.</li>
<li>Space infrastructure would also need to clear space junk from the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, in order to avoid damage to the structures, and increase the safety of future space travel.</li>

<h3 id="proposing-oneill-cylinders"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> Past And Proposed O&rsquo;Neill Cylinders</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-proposing-oneill-cylinders">
<p>
The dimensions and material design of the O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder featured in <i>Futurist Fantasies</i> were based on the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Neill_cylinder">O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder concept</a>.
The original O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder design used conventional design materials.
Most spacecraft use aluminum, iron, or titanium.
Nowadays, most futurists imagine spacecraft that is intended for interplanetary colonization to be made out of materials that are extremely expensive to create.
It also hasn&rsquo;t been demonstrated whether or not it&rsquo;s viable to build such large structures.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, the <i>Futurist Fantasies</i> O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder had an imagined length that was reduced to 10 kilometers long, in order to make it physically possible to build the cylinder with steel.
These hypothetical dimensions are thus not without merit.
</p>

<p>
If it really would cost an estimated $3 quadrillion to build and launch such a megastructure into LEO, then it&rsquo;s clearly not feasible.
The <i>Futurist Fantasies</i> O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder also isn&rsquo;t optimal for interplanetary travel.
The cylinder is too long and wide, and the hull isn&rsquo;t thick enough for radiation shielding or protection against potential micrometeorite impacts.
If we consider more optimal dimensions, then the cylinder will become more likely to achieve its goals, as well as more economical to build.
If space launching infrastructure is built, it may even be able to bypass the limitations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation">Tsiolkovsky rocket equation</a>.
</p>

<p>
I would like to state some reasonable premises for these thought experiments:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I want O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder designs that are <i>optimal</i> and <i>likely</i> to accomplish their intended goals.</li>
<li>I want O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder designs that are <i>likely</i> to withstand interplanetary space travel.</li>
<li>I want to estimate how much it would cost to send such a Cylinder to Mars, or Martian orbit.</li>
<li>I am only interested in constructing spacecraft that are economically and physically possible to build.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not interested in technologies that don&rsquo;t exist, or hypothetical cost reductions that haven&rsquo;t happened yet.
We cannot assume that we can rely on such hypothetical and unseen progress.
There are no guarantees that such progress will actually happen, unless it&rsquo;s <i>provably likely</i> to occur.
Unless it&rsquo;s <i>provably likely</i> that such progress will actually happen, there are no guarantees that it will occur.</li>
<li>I want to know what could potentially go wrong with O&rsquo;Neill Cylinders.
Spacecraft have been accidentally destroyed in the past, so this is definitely worthy of consideration.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Since I want detailed and informed answers to all these questions, this section features questions and answers from the Claude 3.5 Haiku Explanatory LLM.
As far as I know, the O&rsquo;Neill Cylinders in Claude&rsquo;s answers are based on the design concepts proposed at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Origin">Blue Origin</a> space technology company.

<div id="outline-container-mass-energy" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="mass-energy"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> What could be done to obtain Massive Quantities of Energy?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-mass-energy">
<p>
The Earth has enough nuclear energy to last its existence for 4 billion years at the current rate of consumption.
However, much of that nuclear energy may be forever inaccessible since it would have to be filtered out of the Earth&rsquo;s seawater.
Another point is that if there were a hypothetical 2%/year increase in energy usage, the entire world&rsquo;s supply of nuclear energy would only last us maybe 1500 years.
If we want to increase our energy usage substantially more than that, we&rsquo;ll need something more.
</p>

<p>
Another thing is that a Dyson swarm isn&rsquo;t an all or nothing proposal.
Its design is fundamentally decentralized.
You can start building a Dyson swarm with a single solar energy collector.
You can then use the energy collected to do work - work like building another solar energy collector.
If the technology for transporting some of the collected energy exists, then the technology for transporting all of it exists (discounting losses of course).
And it exists in some form today: <a href="https://newatlas.com/energy/long-range-wireless-power-transmission-new-zealand-emrod/">https://newatlas.com/energy/long-range-wireless-power-transmission-new-zealand-emrod/</a> .
It certainly seems plausible that the technology would be vastly easier to do in the vacuum of space and that we can improve it further.
Is the premise that it will never be feasible to A. get a first energy collector around the sun and/or B. create energy collectors using materials that can be found off earth?
</p>

<p>
If a Dyson swarm is not feasible, then it may make more sense to build a bunch of nuclear reactors in space.
Humanity could find ways to run nuclear power on Mars and other planetary bodies, and obtain the necessary energy for space colonization that way instead.

Asteroid mining may be profitable if asteroids are redirected to crash landing sites where it can be mined.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We can&rsquo;t do it yet, and it probably wouldn&rsquo;t work with larger asteroids.</li>
<li>However, it&rsquo;s still better than mining flying asteroids.</li>

<li>Solar sailing is unidirectional. It would be easy to solar sail to Mars, but not very easy to solar sail from Mars back to Earth.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s probably too slow to be considered as a transportation method.</li>
<li>This may apply to all possible methods of space transportation, but what will happen if the solar sails get hit by space debris that tears them apart?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What if the cost of launching objects beyond the Earth&rsquo;s gravity continues to get cheaper?</li>
<li>What if there&rsquo;s a way to leverage the Earth&rsquo;s theoretical supply of 1400 years of nuclear energy to increase the likelihood of space travel?</li>
<li>Anything Else?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Resolving Game-Theoretical Problems That Impede Space Travel:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Suppose that we do solve the modern world&rsquo;s problems of overpopulation, dysgenics, economic inefficiency, cultural insanity, etc
Now suppose that humanity is capable of generating a surplus amount of money ever year, that could be set aside for space travel, and saved until we have enough money to travel to other planets. Could space colonization then be possible?</li>
<li>If we&rsquo;re predicting that our civilization is going collapse, perhaps permanently, then that alone is a pretty strong reason to believe why humanity will never colonize other planets.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Earth will need to be developed, united, stable and to produce immense surpluses for space colonization to be on the table.
As of now, it is significantly more likely that we&rsquo;ll revert back to an anterior technological level once fossil fuels run out.
We do produce surpluses, but they translate into a population explosion, not into a stable system.

<p>
It might be fun to kind of imagine what the progression to interplanetary civilization might look like.
To me, this seems like the most feasible way that comes off the top of my head:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Build a rocket-less launch system (space hook, mass driver, or space elevator on top of a lighter-than-air structure).
This can reduce costs to get to space by 90-99%. Even if its super expensive, it should be well worth it so that we don&rsquo;t need to pay for rockets anymore.</li>
<li>Once we can get to space more cheaply, we can build a mining operation on the moon.
Getting materials from the moon to make space structures would be vastly cheaper than getting them from earth.
The moon has basically the same composition as the earth, so it should have all the materials we need except biological stuff.
Moon mass drivers would be feasible with today&rsquo;s technology.</li>
<li>Once we can get moon material cheaply into space, we can build other structures out there.
More space hooks, space elevators, and orbital mass drivers that can move things around the solar system without much reaction mass.
An interesting idea to think about would be orbital mass drivers that fire one payload opposite the direction of its orbit (speeding it up) and then firing another one in the direction of its orbit (slowing it back down).</li>
<li>Nuclear fission energy could get us far, but even all the fissile material on earth will generate in total less energy than the sun outputs each second.
Fusion might do us a bit better, but even if we never discover how to do net positive fusion, we already have the necessary technology to capture and transmit energy from the sun.
It seems inevitable that we&rsquo;ll eventually have as much energy as we could possibly need.</li>

<h2 id="conclusion"><span class="section-number-2">8.</span> Conclusion On The Practicality Of Space Colonization</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-conclusion">
<p>
It seems that building the infrastructure for launching stuff into space from the Earth would probably be the easiest part, assuming that none of it fails.
No matter how successful humans may prove to be in exceeding the pessimists&rsquo; expectations and building technology and infrastructure for reaching the Moon, Mars, and other planets, there&rsquo;s still always the potential for something to break down and malfunction.
Even if we can build all this technology, I don&rsquo;t see how it will ever benefit humanity to travel to Mars and other planets, and the costs of trying will probably never make a profit.
</p>

<p>
The exception may be building a stellar engine, for escaping an incoming supernova that we could foresee thousands to millions of years in advance.
As with everything relating to technology, I am skeptical that it will be feasible to build a functioning stellar engine.
But if it&rsquo;s necessary to save humanity, then we&rsquo;ll have to try with whatever we can.
</p>

<p>
If there were other nearby planets that had conditions similar to earth for supporting human life, then space colonization would definitely be worth it.
Even if the people living on earth who could not go to the other planet, would not be able to benefit by using the uncolonized extraterrestrial planet to increase service practice success, sending people there could still be a way to correct the Earth&rsquo;s ecological overshoot and prevent overpopulation that would doom <i>everybody</i> on the entire planet.
