<h2 id="intro"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
The best way to challenge our beliefs is to debate them with other people and put our ideas to the test.
I enjoyed reading <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPXKWDVC">Futurist Fantasies</a></i> by T. K. Van Allen, and I believe it made a strong case for why space colonization is highly unlikely.
It&rsquo;s a great book, but there&rsquo;s also a lot that can be added to it, particularly regarding technologies and ideas that it had not considered.
My intention in writing this webpage is to further determine what humanity may be capable of, with greater accuracy.

<div id="outline-container-megastructures" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="megastructures"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Megastructures And Steel</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-megastructures">
<p>
The Megastructures chapter mainly focuses on the strength and weight of steel.
Most futurists are aware that steel would be very heavy and possibly not strong enough for building space travel infrastructure.
This is a list of materials that humanity could <i>hypothetically</i> use for megastructures instead of steel:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Carbon Fiber / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_nanotube">Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs)</a></li>
<li>Kevlar</li>
</ul>

<p>
As of 2025, there is no proof that either of these materials can be used to affordably produced huge spacecraft for human colonization.
All self-sustaining spacecraft that can transport sizable numbers of humans would need multiple square kilometers of surface.
Maybe this will change in the future, but I think it&rsquo;s unlikely.

<h3 id="original-oneill-cylinder"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> The Original O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-original-oneill-cylinder">
<p>
I don&rsquo;t believe that O&rsquo;Neill wasn&rsquo;t trying to create plans that were as detailed as much as possible when he was imagining the cylinder.
It seems that he only wanted to sketch out the main ideas to get some discussion and thinking going.
I base this conclusion on how he said that his proposals to mine materials from the Moon instead of the Earth were only intended to be &ldquo;proofs of existence&rdquo;, how he didn&rsquo;t specify everything about how to build the cylinders, etc.
</p>

<p>
The dimensions and material design of the O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder featured in <i>Futurist Fantasies</i> were based on the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Neill_cylinder">O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder concept, as stated on Wikipedia</a>.
The original O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder design also used conventional design materials.
Most spacecraft use aluminum, iron, or titanium.
Nowadays, most futurists imagine spacecraft that is intended for interplanetary colonization to be made out of materials that are extremely expensive to create.
It also hasn&rsquo;t been demonstrated whether or not it&rsquo;s viable to build such large structures.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, the <i>Futurist Fantasies</i> O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder had an imagined length that was reduced to 10 kilometers long, in order to make it physically possible to build the cylinder with steel.
Van Allen calculated how much it would cost just to send one cylinder into Low Earth orbit:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law">Square/Cube Law</a> makes it very difficult to build advanced megastructures like space elevators, orbital rings, etc.</li>
<li>12km is the maximum length that a steel cable can support its own mass at Earth surface gravity. If it is any longer, it will snap under its own weight.</li>
<li>O&rsquo;Neill Cylinders will probably never be economically feasible to build. If we built an O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder that&rsquo;s 10km long and 6.4 km in diameter, with a 1m thick hull, then it would weigh 3 trillion kg (2 trillion kg of steel, with 1 trillion kg of material).</li>
<li>Putting 1 kg into LEO varies between $50,000 and $1,500. The lowest cost being the Falcon Heavy from SpaceX, but with only 3 completed launches, this is a somewhat optimistic estimate.</li>
<li>So, if we assume a cost of $1000/kg, then putting a 3 trillion kg cylinder into LEO would cost $3 quadrillion ($3,000,000,000,000,000), and that&rsquo;s only for one cylinder.</li>
<li>For comparison, the world&rsquo;s nominal GDP is less than 100 trillion dollars.</li>
</ul>
<p>
&#x2013; Paraphrased/Summarized from <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPXKWDVC">Futurist Fantasies</a></i> by T. K. Van Allen
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If it really would cost an estimated $3 quadrillion to build and launch such a megastructure into LEO, then it&rsquo;s clearly not feasible.
The <i>Futurist Fantasies</i> O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder also isn&rsquo;t optimal for interplanetary travel.
The cylinder is too long and wide, and the hull isn&rsquo;t thick enough for radiation shielding or protection against potential micrometeorite impacts.
If we consider more optimal dimensions, then the cylinder will become more likely to achieve its goals, as well as more economical to build.

There are no guarantees that such progress will actually happen, unless it&rsquo;s <i>provably likely</i> to occur.

<h3 id="smaller-cylinders"><span class="section-number-3">3.3.</span> Why Smaller Cylinders Are Better</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-smaller-cylinders">
<p>
Before we ask Claude questions about O&rsquo;Neill cylinders in the next section, we should establish why it makes sense to make the O&rsquo;Neill cylinders as small as possible:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It will obviously take a lot of resources to build even a single O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder.</li>
<li>Smaller structures are more feasible to build.
Humans still haven&rsquo;t managed to build <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures">buildings that are taller than a kilometer</a>.</li>
<li>Smaller structures will require less energy to launch.</li>
<li><a href="#megastructures">As mentioned before</a>, the spacehook seems like one of the most promising space launching infrastructure ideas out there.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In order to make spacehooks more viable, a constant stream of spacecraft flying between Earth and Mars would be necessary, in order to balance out the gravitational pulls for each spacecraft.</li>
<li>Humanity will have more spacecraft to accomplish this, if the spacecraft are each built smaller.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Smaller structures will be easier to mass produce.
Hypothetically, a galactic space colonization will be much easier if all spacecraft use similar sizes and interchangeable parts.</li>
<li>Smaller structures minimize the potential losses and costs of failure.</li>
<li>The event that a <a href="#proposing-oneill">rather small O&rsquo;Neill cylinder</a> accidentally falls towards the Earth is <a href="#oneill-earth-impact-effects">already dangerous enough as it is</a>.
If the same event happened with a cylinder that was the same size as the original design proposal, the impact would be strong enough to cause a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event#Impact_events">mass extinction event</a> that would probably wipe out most of the life on Earth.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hypothetically, if the space infrastructure, space travel, and colonization all works out, then these life-sustaining spacecraft could be reused to colonize other planets, even after they finish their first journey(s).
</p>

<p>
The only conceivable advantage that bigger spacecraft may have is that they could sustain more people and resources.
This could make the initial colonization of a planetary body easier, if the spacecraft successfully manages to land on the planet with all the life on it still living.
However, larger cylinders simply aren&rsquo;t very realistic.
Smaller structures are more practical by every other measure.
We will thus choose the smallest cylinder from the design proposals mentioned in the next section.

<b>Commentary</b><br>
I should&rsquo;ve noticed this earlier, but I later realized that Claude forgot to correctly specify how thick the cylinder hull would need to be to provide sufficient shielding from radiation.
Note that the cylinder may not need extra mass to block radiation if it stays in LEO, but the cylinder would need shielding if it&rsquo;s supposed to be sent to Mars.
Claude 3.5 Sonnet stated:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
For radiation shielding, we need to account for both cosmic rays and solar radiation.
Studies have shown we need approximately 5-7 meters of shielding material to provide protection equivalent to Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.
Let&rsquo;s analyze the materials:
</p>

<p>
For the main structural hull:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Primary layer: High-strength steel (likely a specialized alloy) for structural integrity</li>
<li>The steel would need to be roughly 5-10 cm thick to handle the rotational forces</li>
<li>Steel density is approximately 7,800 kg/m³</li>
</ul>

<p>
For radiation shielding:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Multiple layers would be optimal</li>
<li>Inner layer: Aluminum (2,700 kg/m³) for secondary particle reduction</li>
<li>Middle layer: Steel or iron for primary radiation absorption</li>
<li>Outer layer: Regolith (approximately 1,500 kg/m³) for additional protection</li>

<hr>
<p>
<b>Commentary</b><br>
We should keep in mind that the estimated $295-793 billion is potentially a huge under-estimate, since the <a href="#oneill-weight">weight calculations</a> didn&rsquo;t correctly account for the thickness of the cylinder hull.
</p>

<p>
However, retrieving most of the materials for the cylinder from the Moon instead of the Earth could make it much cheaper to build:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
To reduce the mass needed from Earth, most of the repetitive structural members (aluminum) and window panels (glass) must be produced at L5 from lunar material. A further, important saving is made by getting 89% of the mass of needed water from oxygen in the plentiful lunar-surface oxides, bringing only 11% of the water mass as liquid hydrogen from Earth. Of the 500,000-ton total mass (see Table 2) for the Model 1 colony, 98% can be obtained from the Moon. The elements most needed are aluminum, titanium, silicon and oxygen. Lunar surface soil is usable for agriculture, with the addition of nitrates and small amounts of trace elements. The remaining 10000 tons must come from the Earth.
</p>

<p>
To bring the total cost within practical limits, we must develop a low-cost method for transporting raw materials from the Moon to the construction site. <i>The discussion of transport methods should be taken as an existence proof rather than as a detailed design</i>. There may very well be better methods than those I have considered; however, it is enough to show two solutions that appear to be workable. Both use the two great advantages of the lunar environment: an excellent vacuum and a very low escape velocity, about 1.5 miles per sec, less than one quarter of the escape velocity from Earth. To bring a kilogram to L5 from the Moon takes less than 5% of the energy needed to take a kilogram from Earth.

<p>
Even then, two cylinders would have to be built to fulfill the original design proposal, and it would still be expensive to build pairs of cylinders and the necessary infrastructure for building them.

The next section will ask about some things that could potentially happen if O&rsquo;Neill Cylinders were orbiting the Earth.
We obviously don&rsquo;t want catastrophic scenarios to happen, but we must be willing to consider them, when preparing ourselves for the future.
Car accidents happen, train accidents happen, plane accidents happen, and spacecraft accidents have happened.
</p>

<p>
For the future, the question isn&rsquo;t if space colonization related accidents will occur.
The question is <i>when</i> will they occur, assuming that space colonization is physically and economically feasible in the first place.

<b>Commentary</b><br>
As we can see, humanity should be <i>extremely</i> cautious about building any structure that is as large as a compact O&rsquo;Neil cylinder, especially if the structure is intended to be sent into space.

<h2 id="space-infrastructure"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> What if humanity builds space travel infrastructure to bring the costs down?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-space-infrastructure">
<p>
In order for human space travel to be physically possible, space launching infrastructure will have to be built, in order to bypass the limitations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation">Tsiolkovsky rocket equation</a>.
Without space travel infrastructure and for as long as humanity is bound to using rockets and jet propellants, <a href="#oneill-tsiolkovsky">space travel will be effectively impossible</a>.
</p>

<p>
Notes about building space travel infrastructure:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The book concludes that space elevators, and orbital rings are all probably unfeasible for space launching infrastructure.</li>
<li>The book also doesn&rsquo;t discuss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyhook_(structure)">skyhooks/spacehooks</a>, but they may be a viable solution for building infrastructure for both space flight ascent <i>and</i> descent.<br>

<div id="outline-container-mass-energy" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="mass-energy"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> What could be done to obtain Massive Quantities of Energy?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-mass-energy">
<p>
Leveraging the world&rsquo;s supply of nuclear energy would grant humanity a lot of energy to work with, but nuclear energy is a non-renewable resource.
Many estimates on <a href="../civilization/climate-change#nuclear-energy-future">the Earth&rsquo;s supply of nuclear energy are also greatly overestimated</a>.
</p>

<p>
A Dyson swarm isn&rsquo;t an all or nothing proposal.
Its design is fundamentally decentralized.
You can start building a Dyson swarm with a single solar energy collector.
You can then use the energy collected to do work - work like building another solar energy collector.
If the technology for transporting some of the collected energy exists, then the technology for transporting all of it exists (discounting losses of course).
And it <a href="https://newatlas.com/energy/long-range-wireless-power-transmission-new-zealand-emrod/">exists in some form today</a>.
It certainly seems plausible that the technology would be vastly easier to do in the vacuum of space and that we can improve it further.
Is the premise that it will never be feasible to A. get a first energy collector around the sun and/or B. create energy collectors using materials that can be found off earth?
</p>

<p>
If a Dyson swarm is not feasible, then it may make more sense to build a bunch of nuclear reactors in space.
Humanity could find ways to run nuclear power on Mars and other planetary bodies, and obtain the necessary energy for space colonization that way instead.

<p>
As mentioned in <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPXKWDVC">Futurist Fantasies</a></i>, it&rsquo;s physically impossible and impractical to mine materials directly from the asteroid belt.
A more plausible and conceivable proposal would thus be to redirect asteroids to crash landing sites where they can be mined, such as Mars or Ceres.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We can&rsquo;t do it yet, and it probably wouldn&rsquo;t work with larger asteroids.</li>
<li>However, it&rsquo;s still better than mining flying asteroids.</li>
<li>This may be a feasible and practical way to saturate planetary colony sites with resources in advance.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Of course though, moving asteroids would require a <i>lot</i> of energy.
This method of asteroid mining would also have to be more efficient than mining Mars for resources in order for it to be economically practical.
</p>

<p>
Currently, mining the Moon for resources and transporting said resources back to Earth seems like that it will be more practical and economical than trying to mine the asteroid belt or colonize Mars.

</ul></li>
<li>What if the cost of launching objects beyond the Earth&rsquo;s gravity continues to get cheaper?</li>
<li>What if there&rsquo;s a way to leverage the Earth&rsquo;s theoretical supply of 1400 years of nuclear energy to increase the likelihood of space travel?</li>
<li>Anything Else?</li>

<p>
Resolving Game-Theoretical Problems That Impede Space Travel:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Suppose that we do solve the modern world&rsquo;s problems of overpopulation, dysgenics, economic inefficiency, cultural insanity, etc
Now suppose that humanity is capable of generating a surplus amount of money ever year, that could be set aside for space travel, and saved until we have enough money to travel to other planets. Could space colonization then be possible?</li>
<li>If we&rsquo;re predicting that our civilization is going collapse, perhaps permanently, then that alone is a pretty strong reason to believe why humanity will never colonize other planets.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Earth will need to be developed, united, stable and able to produce immense resource surpluses before for space colonization and the terraformation of other planets can be placed on the table.
As of now, it is significantly more likely that we&rsquo;ll revert back to an anterior technological level once fossil fuels run out.
We do produce surpluses, but they translate into a population explosion, not into a stable system.

<h2 id="conclusion"><span class="section-number-2">8.</span> Conclusion On The Practicality Of Space Colonization</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-conclusion">
<p>
In the 1960s, people thought that Humanity would&rsquo;ve achieved the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technologies_in_2001:_A_Space_Odyssey#Imagining_the_future">technological advancements in 2001: A Space Odyssey</a> two decades ago, and that still hasn&rsquo;t happen by now.
People need to recognize that <a href="https://zerocontradictions.net/pdfs/rise-and-stagnation-of-modernity.pdf">technological process has clearly slowed down</a>, and we&rsquo;ve nearly reached its limits.
</p>

<p>
I understand that space colonization is a fascinating topic and would be one of the ultimate achievements that humanity could ever do as a species.
I would like to accomplish that goal if it&rsquo;s possible.
But at the end of the day, we also have to recognize that we may fail to ever so.
We live in reality, not a sci-fi fantasy world where humans are invincible.
There are limits to what humans can do in reality.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HNgIJqeyDw">Sabbine Hossenfelder has reached similar conclusions about Mars colonization</a>.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve shown the calculations for why I believe it&rsquo;s far too expensive to launch human colonies onto Mars in the near future, especially when it&rsquo;s still too expensive to be worth colonizing Antarctica or the Sahara Desert.
I also didn&rsquo;t cover over all the physical challenges that would make it virtually impossible (at least with current technology).
My judgment is that space colonization won&rsquo;t be possible for 150-200 years, possibly longer, and probably never (in spite of how much I&rsquo;d want it to happen).
This conclusion is probably contrary to most LessWrongers, but I haven&rsquo;t seen many posts that satisfactorily answer the physical, logistical, and economical challenges to colonizing space.
</p>

<p>
Even if humans could live on Mars, it&rsquo;s worth asking why anyone want to live on Mars when they can live on Earth instead?
Even Antarctica is a thousand times better for human life than Mars.
I personally don&rsquo;t understand why people are fantasizing about colonizing Mars when humans haven&rsquo;t even colonized Antarctica yet.

Musk&rsquo;s SpaceX company is largely a fraud.
SpaceX is highly unlikely to achieve its stated goals by the end of the century, as explained on this page.
Space colonization is unlikely to be successful, and it&rsquo;d probably take 150-200 years for it to succeed, if ever.
Besides Starlink and launching satellites at more economical prices, pretty much everything else that SpaceX does or has ever done has been a waste of resources.
It would be more practical for humanity to <a href="../civilization/space-colonization#conclusion">focus on colonizing Antarctica instead</a>.

Musk has consistently overstated the expected accomplishments of Tesla company.
Tesla has <a href="../images/elon-musk-always-claims-a-year-away.png">repeatedly failed to accomplish</a> what he said would be accomplished within specified time frames.
</p>

<p>
Musk also founded the Boring Company to kill High Speed Rail, thus holding back American energy independence, sustainable infrastructure, lower pollution, etc.
The goal of preventing High Speed Rail adoption was just so that he could make money selling cars.
<a href="https://jalopnik.com/did-musk-propose-hyperloop-to-stop-california-high-spee-1849402460">He&rsquo;s admitted to this</a> and he&rsquo;s largely succeeded at it.
Musk has stalled humanity&rsquo;s progress in favor of his own success.
He has announced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#Hyperloop">plans to build high-speed rail as Hyperloop</a>, but nothing has come out of these proposals.
It was most likely just babbling to get attention.
</p>

<p>
Cars in general are one of the <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/wiki/faq"><i>worst</i> inventions ever created</a> in human history.
For someone who claims to be invested in solving humanity&rsquo;s greatest challenges, he&rsquo;s not helping by playing along with the system.
For humanity to move forward, we need to largely get rid of cars, not renovate them.
Cars are a waste of the <a href="../faqs/overpopulation#nowhere-close-bogus">Earth&rsquo;s scarce resources</a>, and he&rsquo;s not helping to conserve resources by manufacturing more cars and perpetuating the further usage of cars.

Neuralink is one company that he&rsquo;s founded that could have some real potential, but I estimate that it will probably take decades.
Even if Neuralink succeeds at its goals, that would probably do some good for humanity and scientific/technological progress.
But it probably won&rsquo;t be much progress, since <a href="../pdfs/technology-and-progress.pdf">humans are already able to interact with AI to a great degree</a>.
Enabling people to live longer also exacerbates overpopulation.
</p>

<p>
OpenAI and xAI have the potential to do good for this world, but it&rsquo;s unknown how much.
AI has the <a href="../civilization/technology#AI-pros-cons">potential to be abused</a> just as much as it&rsquo;s used to do good.
AGI is still long ways away, and it seems unlikely to surpass human intelligence, both economically and in potential, due to the tremendous energy and computing requirements.
</p>

<p>
Musk left OpenAI in 2018, so he didn&rsquo;t have any influence on the company after that or for most of the company&rsquo;s history.
OpenAI said that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/openai-elon-musk-lawsuit-sam-altman-4a4c0a19316f849f65db9e6d2b0b7a6b">Musk contributed $45 million to the company</a>.
The generative AIs created by OpenAI and other companies <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241220225009/https://suchir.net/fair_use.html">violate fair-use laws</a>, so they are doing arguable harm to the people who created the data used to train LLMs.
</p>

<p>
Twitter has marginally improved since Musk bought the company.
However, people have to pay money in order for their voices to be heard, so Musk has failed to ensure real free speech.
He also arbitrarily censors people on the platform, especially when they criticize him.
Currently, Substack is the best platform for free speech.
Humanity isn&rsquo;t going to save itself or move forward without <a href="../pdfs/freedom-of-speech.pdf">true free speech</a>, so this is a huge deal.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#Leadership_style">leadership style</a> of all his companies is terrible.
I&rsquo;ll grant that many CEOs also have leadership flaws.

Almost certainly not.

I am glad that Musk helped Donald Trump win the 2024 US Presidential election.

However, I dislike Musk&rsquo;s outspoken support for H-1B visas.
It&rsquo;s largely abused as a supply of cheap foreign labor.
Expanding the use of H-1B visas is against the best interests of everyday Americans, and it could have dysgenic effects on the population.

<p>
In general, Musk&rsquo;s politics wouldn&rsquo;t fix most of the world&rsquo;s problems.

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180716104850/https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1009362316536602625">Musk supports consumption tax</a> because that&rsquo;s the tax that would hurt him the least, not because it&rsquo;s the best for society.
He doesn&rsquo;t propose income taxes because that would obviously hurt his companies.
He hasn&rsquo;t spoken in favor of property or land value taxes, because that would tax all the land and properties used for his companies.
And since most of his main companies (SpaceX, Tesla, Boring Company) are funded by the government or subsidies, they wouldn&rsquo;t have to pay much value-added tax.
Tesla gets tax breaks and subsidies, since the government wants to create an image of promoting green energy.

<p>
So far, most of Musk&rsquo;s actions haven&rsquo;t positively changed most people&rsquo;s lives, and certainly not more than some more notable (living) people (e.g. Blithering Genius, Veritasium, Tim Berners Lee, Shuji Nakamura, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, etc; Kary Mullis, Fritz Haber, Steve Jobs, etc).
Musk hasn&rsquo;t made any comparable net positive impact on the world, nor has he contributed more than the exemplary people mentioned.
If he never existed, humanity and the Earth&rsquo;s condition would be largely the same as it already is, and arguably even better.

Elon Musk largely hasn&rsquo;t done anything to make our lives better (although deporting illegal immigrants from the US would his greatest accomplishment), he has no original ideas, he&rsquo;s one of the most narcissistic people on the planet, he&rsquo;s not a nice person, most of his business endeavors are futile, and he&rsquo;s largely a fraud who appeals to people&rsquo;s unrealistic imaginations.
Elon Musk is the most overrated person on Earth.
