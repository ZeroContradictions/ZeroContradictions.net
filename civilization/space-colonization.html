<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
The best way to challenge our beliefs is to debate them with other people and put our ideas to the test.
I enjoyed reading T. K. Van Allen&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPXKWDVC">Futurist Fantasies</a></i>, and I believe it made a strong case for why space colonization is highly unlikely.
It&rsquo;s a great book, but there&rsquo;s also a lot that can be added to it, particularly regarding technologies and ideas that it had not considered.
My intention in writing this webpage is to further determine what humanity may be capable of, with greater accuracy.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-megastructures">
<p>
The Megastructures chapter mainly focuses on the strength and weight of steel.
Most futurists are aware that steel would be very heavy and possibly not strong enough for building space travel infrastructure.
This is a list of materials that humanity could <i>hypothetically</i> use for megastructures instead of steel:
</p>

<div id="outline-container-original-oneill-cylinder" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="original-oneill-cylinder"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> The Original O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-original-oneill-cylinder">
<p>
The dimensions and material design of the O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder featured in <i>Futurist Fantasies</i> were based on the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Neill_cylinder">O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder concept</a>.
The original O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder design used conventional design materials.
Most spacecraft use aluminum, iron, or titanium.
Nowadays, most futurists imagine spacecraft that is intended for interplanetary colonization to be made out of materials that are extremely expensive to create.
It also hasn&rsquo;t been demonstrated whether or not it&rsquo;s viable to build such large structures.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, the <i>Futurist Fantasies</i> O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder had an imagined length that was reduced to 10 kilometers long, in order to make it physically possible to build the cylinder with steel.
Van Allen calculated how much it would cost just to send one cylinder into Low Earth orbit:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law">Square/Cube Law</a> makes it physically impossible to build megastructures like space elevators, mass drivers, orbital rings, etc.</li>
<li>12km is the maximum length that a steel cable can support its own mass at Earth surface gravity. If it is any longer, it will snap under its own weight.</li>
<li>O&rsquo;Neill Cylinders will never be economically feasible to build. If we built an O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder that&rsquo;s 10km long and 6.4 km in diameter, with a 1m thick hull, then it would weigh 3 trillion kg (2 trillion kg of steel, with 1 trillion kg of material).</li>
<li>Putting 1 kg into LEO varies between $50,000 and $1,500. The lowest cost being the Falcon Heavy from SpaceX, but with only 3 completed launches, this is a somewhat optimistic estimate.</li>
<li>So, if we assume a cost of $1000/kg, then putting a 3 trillion kg cylinder into LEO would cost $3 quadrillion ($3,000,000,000,000,000), and that&rsquo;s only for one cylinder.</li>
<li>For comparison, the world&rsquo;s nominal GDP is less than 100 trillion dollars.</li>
</ul>
<p>
&#x2013; T. K. Van Allen, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPXKWDVC">Futurist Fantasies</a></i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If it really would cost an estimated $3 quadrillion to build and launch such a megastructure into LEO, then it&rsquo;s clearly not feasible.
The <i>Futurist Fantasies</i> O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder also isn&rsquo;t optimal for interplanetary travel.
The cylinder is too long and wide, and the hull isn&rsquo;t thick enough for radiation shielding or protection against potential micrometeorite impacts.
If we consider more optimal dimensions, then the cylinder will become more likely to achieve its goals, as well as more economical to build.

<p>
I would like to state some reasonable premises for these thought experiments:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I want O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder designs that are <i>optimal</i> and <i>likely</i> to accomplish their intended goals.</li>
<li>I want O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder designs that are <i>likely</i> to withstand interplanetary space travel.</li>
<li>I want to estimate how much it would cost to send such a Cylinder to Mars, or Martian orbit.</li>
<li>I am only interested in constructing spacecraft that are economically and physically possible to build.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not interested in technologies that don&rsquo;t exist, or hypothetical cost reductions that haven&rsquo;t happened yet.
We cannot assume that we can rely on such hypothetical and unseen progress.
There are no guarantees that such progress will actually happen, unless it&rsquo;s <i>provably likely</i> to occur.
Unless it&rsquo;s <i>provably likely</i> that such progress will actually happen, there are no guarantees that it will occur.</li>
<li>I want to know what could potentially go wrong with O&rsquo;Neill Cylinders.
Spacecraft have been accidentally destroyed in the past, so this is definitely worthy of consideration.</li>

<h3 id="smaller-cylinders"><span class="section-number-3">3.3.</span> Why Smaller Cylinders Are Better</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-smaller-cylinders">
<p>
Before we ask Claude questions about O&rsquo;Neill cylinders in the next section, we should establish why it makes sense to make the O&rsquo;Neill cylinders as small as possible:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It will obviously take a lot of resources to build even a single O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder.</li>
<li>Smaller structures are more feasible to build.
Humans still haven&rsquo;t managed to build <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures">buildings that are taller than a kilometer</a>.</li>
<li>Smaller structures will require less energy to launch.</li>
<li><a href="#megastructures">As mentioned before</a>, the spacehook seems like one of the most promising space launching infrastructure ideas out there.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In order to make spacehooks more viable, a constant stream of spacecraft flying between Earth and Mars would be necessary, in order to balance out the gravitational pulls for each spacecraft.</li>
<li>Humanity will have more spacecraft to accomplish this, if the spacecraft are each built smaller.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Smaller structures will be easier to mass produce.
Hypothetically, a galactic space colonization will be much easier if all spacecraft use similar sizes and interchangeable parts.</li>
<li>Smaller structures minimize the potential losses and costs of failure.</li>
<li>The event that a <a href="#proposing-oneill">rather small O&rsquo;Neill cylinder</a> accidentally falls towards the Earth is <a href="#oneill-earth-impact-effects">already dangerous enough as it is</a>.
If the same event happened with a cylinder that was the same size as the original design proposal, the impact would be strong enough to cause a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event#Impact_events">mass extinction event</a> that would probably wipe out most of the life on Earth.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hypothetically, if the space infrastructure, space travel, and colonization all works out, then these life-sustaining spacecraft could be reused to colonize other planets, even after they finish their first journey(s).
</p>

<p>
The only conceivable advantage that bigger spacecraft may have is that they could sustain more people and resources.
This could make the initial colonization of a planetary body easier, if the spacecraft successfully manages to land on the planet with all the life on it still living.
However, larger cylinders simply aren&rsquo;t very realistic.
Smaller structures are more practical by every other measure.
We will thus choose the smallest cylinder from the design proposals mentioned in the next section.

<b>Commentary</b><br>
We should keep in mind that the estimated $295-793 billion would only be enough to build just <i>one</i> O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder within Earth orbit.
Given the <a href="#oneill-construction">measurements and design that were specified earlier</a>, a Mars Direct Mission would only be big enough to house an estimated 100-250 people.
With current technology, space colonization clearly won&rsquo;t be affordable or accessible to most people, nor is it a viable solution to <a href="../faqs/overpopulation">overpopulation</a>.

I&rsquo;ll break down the launch cost calculation using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation">Tsiolkovsky rocket equation</a>, providing a comprehensive analysis of the launch economics for our Mars Direct Mission O&rsquo;Neill Cylinder.

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Initial Mass Calculation:
m0 = Cylinder Mass + Propellant Mass<br>
m0 = 129,000,000 kg + (129,000,000 kg * 0.92)<br>

<b>Commentary</b><br>
TL;DR: The rocket equation guarantees that it will be impossible to ever launch enough propellant fuel into space, for getting a life-sustaining human colonization spacecraft from Earth to its destination.
</p>

<p>
The next section will ask about some things that could potentially happen if O&rsquo;Neill Cylinders were orbiting the Earth.
We obviously don&rsquo;t want catastrophic scenarios to happen, but we must be willing to consider them, when preparing ourselves for the future.
Car accidents happen, train accidents happen, plane accidents happen, and spacecraft accidents have happened.
</p>

<p>
For the future, the question isn&rsquo;t if space colonization related accidents will occur.
The question is <i>when</i> will they occur, assuming that space colonization is physically and economically feasible in the first place.

<b>Commentary</b><br>
As we can see, humanity should be <i>extremely</i> cautious about building any structure that is as large as a compact O&rsquo;Neil cylinder, especially if the structure is intended to be sent into space.
A single mistake or accident could potentially cause unprecedented destruction and devastation to the entire planet.

<h2 id="space-infrastructure"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> What if humanity builds space travel infrastructure to bring the costs down?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-space-infrastructure">
<p>
In order for human space travel to be physically possible, space launching infrastructure will have to be built, in order to bypass the limitations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation">Tsiolkovsky rocket equation</a>.
Without space travel infrastructure and for as long as humanity is bound to using rockets and jet propellants, <a href="#oneill-tsiolkovsky">space travel will be effectively impossible</a>.
</p>

<p>
Notes about building space travel infrastructure:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The book concludes that space elevators, mass drivers, and orbital rings are all probably unfeasible for space launching infrastructure.
I don&rsquo;t know much about mass drivers, but so far, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_50TM3OeEw">they have been successful with launching 200kg objects</a>.</li>
<li>The book also doesn&rsquo;t discuss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyhook_(structure)">skyhooks/spacehooks</a>, but they may be a viable solution for building infrastructure for both space flight ascent <i>and</i> descent.<br>
Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqwpQarrDwk">1,000km Cable to the Stars: The Skyhook - Kurzgesagt</a>.</li>
<li>Space infrastructure would also need to clear space junk from the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, in order to avoid damage to the structures, and increase the safety of future space travel.</li>

<h2 id="mass-energy"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> What could be done to obtain Massive Quantities of Energy?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-mass-energy">
<p>
Leveraging the world&rsquo;s supply of nuclear energy would grant humanity a lot of energy to work with, but nuclear energy is a non-renewable resource.
Many estimates on <a href="../civilization/climate-change#nuclear-energy-future">the Earth&rsquo;s supply of nuclear energy are also greatly overestimated</a>.
</p>

<p>
A Dyson swarm isn&rsquo;t an all or nothing proposal.
Its design is fundamentally decentralized.
You can start building a Dyson swarm with a single solar energy collector.
You can then use the energy collected to do work - work like building another solar energy collector.
If the technology for transporting some of the collected energy exists, then the technology for transporting all of it exists (discounting losses of course).
And it <a href="https://newatlas.com/energy/long-range-wireless-power-transmission-new-zealand-emrod/">exists in some form today</a>.
It certainly seems plausible that the technology would be vastly easier to do in the vacuum of space and that we can improve it further.
Is the premise that it will never be feasible to A. get a first energy collector around the sun and/or B. create energy collectors using materials that can be found off earth?
</p>

<p>
If a Dyson swarm is not feasible, then it may make more sense to build a bunch of nuclear reactors in space.
Humanity could find ways to run nuclear power on Mars and other planetary bodies, and obtain the necessary energy for space colonization that way instead.

<h2 id="asteroid-mining"><span class="section-number-2">6.</span> Asteroid Mining</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-asteroid-mining">
<p>
As mentioned in <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPXKWDVC">Futurist Fantasies</a></i>, it&rsquo;s physically impossible and impractical to mine materials directly from the asteroid belt.
A more plausible and conceivable proposal would thus be to redirect asteroids to crash landing sites where they can be mined, such as Mars or Ceres.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We can&rsquo;t do it yet, and it probably wouldn&rsquo;t work with larger asteroids.</li>
<li>However, it&rsquo;s still better than mining flying asteroids.</li>
<li>This may be a feasible and practical way to saturate planetary colony sites with resources in advance.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Of course though, moving asteroids would require a <i>lot</i> of energy.
This method of asteroid mining would also have to be more efficient than mining Mars for resources in order for it to be economically practical.

</ul></li>
<li>What if the cost of launching objects beyond the Earth&rsquo;s gravity continues to get cheaper?</li>

<p>
Resolving Game-Theoretical Problems That Impede Space Travel:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Suppose that we do solve the modern world&rsquo;s problems of overpopulation, dysgenics, economic inefficiency, cultural insanity, etc
Now suppose that humanity is capable of generating a surplus amount of money ever year, that could be set aside for space travel, and saved until we have enough money to travel to other planets. Could space colonization then be possible?</li>
<li>If we&rsquo;re predicting that our civilization is going collapse, perhaps permanently, then that alone is a pretty strong reason to believe why humanity will never colonize other planets.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Earth will need to be developed, united, stable and to produce immense surpluses for space colonization to be on the table.
As of now, it is significantly more likely that we&rsquo;ll revert back to an anterior technological level once fossil fuels run out.
We do produce surpluses, but they translate into a population explosion, not into a stable system.

<h2 id="conclusion"><span class="section-number-2">8.</span> Conclusion On The Practicality Of Space Colonization</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-conclusion">
<p>
In the 1960s, people thought that Humanity would&rsquo;ve achieved the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technologies_in_2001:_A_Space_Odyssey#Imagining_the_future">technological advancements in 2001: A Space Odyssey</a> two decades ago, and that still hasn&rsquo;t happen by now.
People need to recognize that <a href="https://zerocontradictions.net/pdfs/rise-and-stagnation-of-modernity.pdf">technological process has clearly slowed down</a>, and we&rsquo;ve nearly reached its limits.
</p>

<p>
I understand that space colonization is a fascinating topic and would be one of the ultimate achievements that humanity could ever do as a species.
I would like to accomplish that goal if it&rsquo;s possible.
But at the end of the day, we also have to recognize that we may fail to ever so.
We live in reality, not a sci-fi fantasy world where humans are invincible.
There are limits to what humans can do in reality.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve shown the calculations for why I believe it&rsquo;s far too expensive to launch human colonies onto Mars in the near future, especially when it&rsquo;s still too expensive to be worth colonizing Antarctica or the Sahara Desert.
I also didn&rsquo;t cover over all the physical challenges that would make it virtually impossible (at least with current technology).
My judgment is that space colonization won&rsquo;t be possible for 150-200 years, possibly longer, and probably never (in spite of how much I&rsquo;d want it to happen).
This conclusion is probably contrary to most LessWrongers, but I haven&rsquo;t seen many posts that satisfactorily answer the physical, logistical, and economical challenges to colonizing space.
</p>

<p>
Even if humans could live on Mars, it&rsquo;s worth asking why anyone want to live on Mars when they can live on Earth instead?
Even Antarctica is a thousand times better for human life than Mars.
I personally don&rsquo;t understand why people are fantasizing about colonizing Mars when humans haven&rsquo;t even colonized Antarctica yet.

It&rsquo;s widely known that smaller goals are easier to accomplish than bigger goals, and realistic goals are more practical than less realistic goals.
If humanity is serious about space colonization, I believe that we should take baby steps before we colonize Mars and beyond:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Finish colonizing the Earth: Colonize Antarctica. Irrigate the Sahara Desert. Et Cetera.</li>

<li>Build the most cost-effective space launching infrastructure that is likely to succeed.</li>
<li>Colonize the Moon. Set up space launching infrastructure for the Moon.</li>
<li>Colonize Mars. Set up space launching infrastructure for Mars.</li>
<li>Explore and colonize the rest of space, if possible.</li>
