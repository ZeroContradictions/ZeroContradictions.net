<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-intro">
<p>
See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change">Wikipedia: Climate Change</a>.
</p>

<p>
I support the scientific consensus that climate change and global warming are ongoing, human-caused, and likely to have strong negative consequences for humans, the Earth, and the world&rsquo;s ecosystems.
The evidence is clear that the greenhouse gas levels the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, the Earth&rsquo;s sea levels, and the Earth&rsquo;s temperatures are the highest they have ever been in modern human history.
The best explanation for why such significant changes to the Earth&rsquo;s ecology have occurred in such a geologically short time period is that the Industrial Revolution caused humans to start burn fossil fuels for energy.
</p>

<p>
However, I also believe that climate change has become <a href="#moralization">moralized and politicized on both sides</a>.
This has caused people to have a lot of propaganda and inaccurate information to arise.
There are many ecological phenomena that have been wrongly attributed to climate change, since their causes have been misidentified.
In this essay, I will talk about climate change, how it compares to other ecological issues, my predictions for the future, and what humanity should do to stop climate change and address related ecological issues.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-why-climate-change-matters">
<div class="opponent" id="orgf2e6c8c">
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_(climate)">The Earth is estimated</a> to have had much higher temperatures, CO<sub>2</sub> levels, and other differing ecological conditions millions of years ago.
</p>

<p>
The climate has always been fluctuating significantly throughout the Earth&rsquo;s recorded history.
</p>

</div>
<p>
That is true.
However, we also have to keep in mind that modern humans evolved during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Period">Last Glacial Period</a> when the planet was much cooler.
From a bio-evolutionary perspective, it makes sense that humans would want to keep the Earth at cooler temperatures than the projected temperatures that we are predicting decades from now.
As global temperatures continue to rise and the climate continues to change, humans will become increasingly more maladapted to the Earth&rsquo;s environmental conditions.
</p>

<p>
Warmer temperatures and increasingly heat waves also aren&rsquo;t the only threat of climate change.
Rising sea levels would make it easier to flood coastal cities that are close to the sea level during high tide.
Decreasing biodiversity is also a concern, but I predict that it won&rsquo;t affect humans very much.
</p>

<p>
If we want ourselves, the next generations, and the Earth&rsquo;s flora and fauna to avoid struggling with the negative consequences of these changing ecological conditions, then <a href="#solutions">we should act now</a> to prevent further global warming.
If possible, it&rsquo;d also be ideal if we can <a href="#reversing-climate-change">find a way to reverse global warming</a> and its effects.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
To be clear, I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> saying that humans will die out or cease to exist if humanity fails to prevent further climate change.
If that happens, humans will probably adapt and evolve to have traits that make it easier to survive to live in hotter climates.
Humans who evolved to live near the equator and other hot climates are probably the most well-adapted to surviving in hot climates.
However, just because humans could evolve to survive on a hotter Earth, that doesn&rsquo;t mean climate change isn&rsquo;t a problem to worry about.
</p>

<p>
When the environmental conditions for a population change, these changes are unpleasant for the organisms who are the least well adapted to the new changes.
If the changes are drastic and sudden enough, the least well adapted organisms will die out and fail to produce successful offspring.
There are at least three implications that follow from this:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Lots of people will die during the heatwaves, especially if they don&rsquo;t have technology to help them survive in the new climate, or if the infrastructure for modern technology (e.g. air conditioning, electricity, etc) fails on a global scale. This also depends on how rapidly the changes occur.</li>
<li>Humans who evolved live in colder climates are the most likely to die during the heat waves. This notably includes people of European descent, <a href="../FAQs/race-FAQs#great-replacement">who are already among the fastest declining populations in the world</a>.</li>
<li>Many non-human species will go extinct if the average global temperature continues to rise.</li>

<h3 id="moralization"><span class="section-number-3">1.2.</span> The Politicization and Moralization of Climate Change</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-moralization">
<p>
There are plenty of examples of how Climate Change has become <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/07/what-is-morality.html">moralized</a>.
Many people virtue signal about climate change, just to get attention, social status, and/or political support.

<li><a href="#misidentified-phenomena">Many phenomena are erroneously attributed to climate change</a>.</li>
<li>The worst and most prominent climate change activists tend to propose <a href="#ineffective-solutions">unrealistic or ineffective solutions to climate change</a>. If many of their proposals were implemented, society would grind to a halt. Other proposals won&rsquo;t work because they don&rsquo;t understand game theory.</li>
<li>Many people criticize the actions and hypocrisy of people who are contributing to climate change. Often times, the criticism is justified, but it&rsquo;s also often hypocritical on the part of the criticizers, since <a href="#unwillingness-and-hypocrisy">most people have no interest in restricting their own environmental footprint</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/05/why-most-academic-research-is-fake.html">A Lot of Academic Research is Fake</a>.
Academics have many incentives to lie, exaggerate, and moralize climate change.
We can be certain that some academic observations and predictions are true, but many of them are probably false.</li>

<div class="opponent" id="org6a9856e">
<p>
How do you separate virtue-signaling from genuine, rational activism?
</p>

</div>
<p>
Sometimes that can be difficult, but these are some good general guidelines:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If a person is misidentifying the causes of the problem(s) that they are concerned about, then that&rsquo;s a good indication that they never bothered to think enough about what the problem actually is.
If one doesn&rsquo;t understand the problem, then they don&rsquo;t have any solutions.
If they don&rsquo;t have any solutions, then they&rsquo;re only virtue-signaling.
Real activism has to be rational, informed, and have effective solutions.</li>
<li>If a person is proposing <a href="#ineffective-solutions">ineffective solutions that won&rsquo;t solve the problem</a>, then they&rsquo;re not an activist, or at least not an effective one.
It&rsquo;s rational to label people as idiots and virtue-signalers, if they&rsquo;re propose ineffective solutions that won&rsquo;t work.</li>
<li>If a person is exaggerating the problem, then they&rsquo;re a virtue-signaler, not an activist. <a href="../civilization/social-justice">Wokists tend to exaggerate the problems</a> of many other social issues as well.
A true activist would be concerned with understanding and promoting the truth.</li>
<li>If a person criticizes the environmental footprints of other people, while <a href="#unwillingness-and-hypocrisy">doing nothing to reduce their own footprint</a> (consumption of resources and pollution), then they are a hypocrite and a virtue-signaler.
Genuine activism cannot be hypocritical.</li>
<li>If a person is virtue-signaling or fearmongering because they <a href="#conflicts-of-interest">have a conflict of interest</a> (and hence personally benefit from people worrying about such issues), then they&rsquo;re not a true activist, especially if their actions in the conflict of interest are unlikely to address the problem.
It&rsquo;s more likely that they&rsquo;re just yet another selfish person who is seeking to promote their interests, even if that entails misleading people.</li>
</ol>

<div id="outline-container-conflicts-of-interest" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="conflicts-of-interest"><span class="section-number-3">1.3.</span> Propaganda and Conflicts of Interest</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-conflicts-of-interest">
<p>
The most obvious entities that have conflicts of interest for accurately understanding and assessing climate change are <a href="https://popularresistance.org/just-100-companies-responsible-for-71-of-global-emissions-study-says/">corporations or entities</a> that extract or use a lot of fossil fuels or energy (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuels_lobby">Fossil Fuels Lobby</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Oil">Big Oil</a>).
Climate change activists have been quick to point those entities out, but ironically they&rsquo;ve failed to identify entities who have an interest in exaggerating climate change.
We&rsquo;ve covered how <a href="#moralization">climate change has become moralized and politicized</a>.
We also shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if renewable energy companies have a conflict of interest to exaggerate climate change outcomes, especially since they have an economic incentive to do so.
</p>

<p>
Some people also directly or indirectly benefit from global warming.
Countries may directly benefit from global warming if they have land and territories in colder than average regions of the Earth.
Alternatively, they may gain benefits or perceive benefits from doing things that unintentionally cause the Earth to warm as a side effect.
There is another reason why it&rsquo;s difficult to prevent global warming.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-pollution">
<p>
The increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) levels could be considered a type of air pollution.
Since global warming and climate change are mainly caused by rising GHG levels, all global warming problems could be considered pollution problems as well.
I&rsquo;d even argue that pollution is a bigger problem than climate change since <a href="#reversing-climate-change">global warming is conceivably reversible</a>, whereas some types of pollution are not.

<p>
Most people accept that the following events cause climate change:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Human Activity -&gt; Fossil Fuel Consumption -&gt; Greenhouse Gas Emissions -&gt; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect">Greenhouse Effect</a> -&gt; Global Warming -&gt; Climate Change.</li>

<li>Global Warming -&gt; Ecosystems, Flora and Fauna Change -&gt; Climate Change.</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, most people are unaware of the following causal relationships:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Human Population Growth -&gt; Increased Human Activity.</li>
<li>Unregulated Resource Consumption -&gt; Anti-Environmental Human Activity.</li>
<li>Unregulated Human Population Growth -&gt; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overshoot_(population)">Overshoot</a> -&gt; Overpopulation -&gt; War -&gt; Famine -&gt; Civilizational Crisis.</li>

</ul>

<hr>
<p>
<a href="#why-climate-change-matters">I believe that climate change is a problem and a legitimate concern</a>.
But Humanity also has much bigger problems to solve.
In particular, the conditional statements above reveal that reducing human population growth should be a priority for humanity.
Reducing population growth would help: 1. reduce fossil fuel consumption, 2. avoid overpopulation, 3. avoid climate change.
<a href="../FAQs/overpopulation-FAQs#overpop-threat">Reducing population growth would partially alleviate virtually every problem</a> that humanity is facing today in some way.
Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s very taboo to promote population control.
Most people don&rsquo;t want to accept that population growth is a problem, nor do they want to recognize that population control will be necessary.
</p>

<p>
Running out of oil is simultaneously one of the likeliest and hardest-to-avoid reasons for a large-scale civilizational collapse.
Humanity currently relies on oil for ~30% of its total energy consumption.
Even worse, a majority of the world&rsquo;s vehicles are powered by gasoline.
If the world runs out of oil, there will be no easy way to use a majority of those vehicles, and all the infrastructure that relies on them will fall apart.
Electric vehicles could partially alleviate this problem, but it may not be feasible to use EVs everywhere.

<p>
Overpopulation is a thousand times more problematic than pollution or climate change is.
They both exacerbate each other, but once there&rsquo;s overpopulation, it&rsquo;s basically <a href="../FAQs/overpopulation-FAQs#if-no-pop-regulation">game over for civilization</a>.
Overpopulation causes civilizations to fight wars with each other over scarce resources, until they finally collapse from nearly decimating each other.
</p>

<p>
Civilization rose and fall in the Mayan world many times over thousands of years.
There was a constant cycle of growing civilization, overpopulation, and collapse.
Life continued that way in the Americans for thousands of years until the Europeans came and built a much more advanced civilization.
We have yet to see if this current civilization will collapse as well, but we can predict that it will fall too, unless <a href="#solutions">some serious reforms are made</a>.

<h3 id="why-public-fears"><span class="section-number-3">1.6.</span> Why Do People Fear Climate Change More Than Overpopulation?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-why-public-fears">
<p>
Human activity since the Industrial Revolution has had a lot of negative ecological consequences for the Earth.
While climate change is a consequence of this, it has become <a href="#moralization">a heavily moralized and politicized issue</a>.
This moralization has caused multiple ecological issues to be erroneously attributed to global warming and climate change.
This is problematic because we cannot and will not be able to improve the environment until we accurately identify what&rsquo;s causing the environmental degradation.
</p>

<p>
I argue that <a href="#comparison-to-other-issues">overpopulation is a <i>much</i> greater concern for humanity</a> than climate change.
But if that&rsquo;s true, then why are more people worried about climate change?
I can think of multiple reasons:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornucopianism">Cornucopian</a> propaganda is supported by <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2016/08/the-establishment.html">the Establishment</a>.
The propaganda has been so effective that a majority of people <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition">believe that the world population will peak</a> at 11-12 billion in 2060 or so.</li>
<li>Climate Change narratives are supported by the Establishment.
The consensus in academia is that climate change is real and human-caused (which is correct) because academics can notice the effects more easily than they can recognize population overshoot.</li>
<li>Climate Change can be <a href="https://popularresistance.org/just-100-companies-responsible-for-71-of-global-emissions-study-says/">blamed on corporations</a>, which is consistent with <a href="../#wokism">humanism and wokism</a>.<br>
In reality, virtually everybody depends on corporations for their survival, and the largest corporations wouldn&rsquo;t be powerful if that weren&rsquo;t the case.
But it&rsquo;s easy for most people to ignore that part, especially if they have an ideological bias against businesses.</li>
<li>Overpopulation cannot be blamed on any particular group of people.
Acknowledging that overpopulation is a problem would implicate that every living human is at least partially contributing to the problem in same way by consuming resources and causing pollution.
Anybody who is not part of the solution is part of the problem.
This conflicts with the moral intuitions of Humanism.</li>
<li><a href="../FAQs/overpopulation-FAQs#overpop-solution">Regulating how many children people can have</a> (if any) conflicts with the humanist values of hedonism and utilitarianism.</li>
<li>Population concerns could imply <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6nG7RloYf0">restricting immigration to the West</a>, which conflicts with the humanist values of hedonism and utilitarianism.</li>
<li>Some people don&rsquo;t want to accept that human population growth makes climate change worse.</li>
<li>People can personally observe climate change directly, which verifies to people that it&rsquo;s real.</li>
<li>By contrast, the negative consequences of overpopulation are less noticeable and they cannot be observed until overpopulation happens.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The negative consequences of climate change occur gradually and progressively.</li>
<li>The negative consequences of overpopulation (e.g. mass death) tend to happen all at once.</li>
<li>Most people are generally biased towards denying that ecosystems are overpopulated, until they step over the tipping point for causing mass death. It may take years or decades for most people to finally realize that an ecosystem is overpopulated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="#misidentified-phenomena">A lot of bad or seemingly bad phenomena</a> are erroneously attributed to climate change, which makes people think climate change is worse than it actually is.</li>

DTT plays an important role in the humanist worldview.
It is part of a &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, be happy&rdquo; view of human nature and reality.
&#x2013; Blithering Genius, <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/01/demography-and-destiny.html">Demography and Destiny</a>
</p>

</div>
<p>
I mostly agree with Blithering Genius in this quote.
However, I&rsquo;d say that climate change is a major exception to the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry, be happy&rdquo; view of humanists.
One reason is that anger and hatred are natural emotions, and they have to be directed towards <i>someone</i>.
For climate change, it may feel therapeutic to blame corporations and other people for the world&rsquo;s problems, whereas overpopulation cannot be blamed on a group of bad guys, as aforementioned.
The same goes for the obsession with racism, sexism, homophobia, etc.
Another reason is that some people probably find appealing to believe in some sort of apocalypse that they can virtue-signal towards people about.
</p>

<p>
Persuading humanists to redirect their fears for climate change towards overpopulation will be a tremendous challenge.
<a href="#public-awareness">I have a few ideas that could help with this</a>, but they probably won&rsquo;t be enough on their own.
Most people will probably never worry about overpopulation until they start to feel at least some of its consequences and realize that it&rsquo;s a problem.

<h3 id="desertification"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Desertification</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-desertification">
<p>
Technically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertification">desertification</a> is a type of climate change.
Climate change can cause feedback loops in some cases, so it&rsquo;s feasible that one type of climate change could cause a different type of climate change.
However, it needs to be clear that desertification is <i>not</i> caused by increased temperatures or GHG levels.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If anything, a warmer climate, by itself, would cause accelerated plant growth.
A warmer climate would accelerate the rate of evaporation over the Earth&rsquo;s oceans, which would result in greater precipitation over the Earth&rsquo;s land.
This would accelerate the Earth&rsquo;s water cycle.
Likewise, increasing the availability of atmospheric carbon for plants to absorb is beneficial for photosynthesis.
Together, these conditions are highly conducive to plant growth, so they would result in a jungle, not a desert.
</p>

<p>
For a historical example, the Earth was much warmer and had a higher CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboniferous">Carboniferous Era</a>.
As we would expect, most of the Earth was covered in forests, swamps, and jungles during this era.
</p>

<p>
In the modern era, the true cause of desertification is human activity.
Cutting down forests, overgrazing by livestock, and redirecting freshwater to cities for human consumption all contribute to desertification.
<a href="https://blog.kulikulifoods.com/2015/11/05/deforestation-in-haiti/">The striking contrast on the Haitian/Dominican Republican border</a> is one of the clearest examples of this.

<h3 id="wildfires"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Wildfires</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-wildfires">
<p>
It&rsquo;s likely that global warming has probably contributed to the increase in wildfires to some extent, but it&rsquo;s not the main problem.
<a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/09/fires-polar-bears-and-global-warming.html">Wildfires would still occur in some forests irregardless of global warming</a>, because they&rsquo;re part of the natural cycle of fire-prone ecosystems.
We know that some forests have undergone literally of decades mismanagement, so this will only increase the frequency of wildfires in future years.
Hence, we cannot determine if global warming is increasing the frequency of wildfires.
</p>

<p>
Claiming that any particular wildfire was caused by global warming is an instance of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc">post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy</a>.
It&rsquo;s also an example of <a href="../epistemology/reasoning-skills#biased-factor-attribution">biased factor attribution</a>, a phenomenon that I&rsquo;ve observed.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-tropical-cyclones">
<p>
Similarly to wildfires, there&rsquo;s reasoning to believe that global warming could increase the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones.
Warm water provides the necessary energy for causing cyclones, so it follows that increasing global temperatures could cause more cyclones.

<p>
Just because climate change is real, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that we can point to any cyclone that has recently occurred and claim that it was caused or intensified by climate change.
That is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc">post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy</a>.
Even if climate change is real and is theorized to increase the intensity of tropical cyclones, it&rsquo;s also possible that similar cyclones still could&rsquo;ve occurred without climate change.
And even if there&rsquo;s a year with a higher-than-average frequency of tropical cyclones (while climate change is ongoing), it&rsquo;s also possible that a similar number of cyclones still would&rsquo;ve occurred even without climate change.

<p>
Instead of making post hoc fallacies, it would be more scientific to analyze the frequency of tropical cyclones each year.
If we notice that the <i>average</i> frequency and <i>average</i> intensity of cyclones is higher than previous centuries or decades, only then can we conjecture that global warming is a possible cause of this.
Even if we observe a strong positive correlation between temperatures and cyclones, we would still have to consider other causes to avoid the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation">correlation does not imply causation fallacy</a>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-dying-organisms">
<p>
People have also blamed dying animals on climate change.
It&rsquo;s true climate change is causing some animals to die (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_bleaching">coral bleaching</a>), but most animals don&rsquo;t die due to climate change.
In <i><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/09/fires-polar-bears-and-global-warming.html">Fires, Polar Bears and Global Warming</a></i>, Blithering Genius talks about a specific example of how starving polar bear was unjustifiably blamed on climate change.

<p>
For some ecosystems, <a href="#desertification">desertification</a> and <a href="#pollution">pollution</a> pose much greater threats to biodiversity and stability, and they are both human-caused.
Even though desertification and pollution are arguably more problematic, they don&rsquo;t seem to get anywhere near the same public attention as climate change does.
I&rsquo;m not entirely sure why this is, especially since there is no moral stigma against worrying about pollution and desertification, as <a href="#why-public-fears">there is for worrying about human overpopulation</a>.
My guess is that climate change gets more publicity in the media, which causes more people to be concerned with it than other issues.

<p>
We can&rsquo;t predict precisely when some areas of the world will become unsustainable to live in or why global warming is a threat to human prosperity.
But most people are okay with that, and most people outside the United States understand that more needs to be done in order to prevent it or reverse it.
That&rsquo;s because people are already feeling their effects or climate change right now and seeing it the consequences with their own eyes.
</p>

<p>
Making analogies between overpopulation and climate change may help people to understand overpopulation better.
For one example, most people are not aware that overpopulation has to be calculated with a mathematical model since the threat of overpopulation is so widely dismissed.
By contrast, many people are aware that climate change must be predicted by mathematical models.
This is mainly because there are many informative resources out there they explain the factors are used to compute climate change models.
</p>


<p>
I suspect that many climate change models are deliberately exaggerated, due to <a href="#conflicts-of-interest">conflicts of interest</a>.
</p>


<p>
I&rsquo;ve studied differential equations, so I&rsquo;m familiar with the math that climate scientists using to make their (biased) predictions.
I would even question if differential equations are even practical for predicting future global temperatures since there&rsquo;s way too many variables to keep track of for them to be useful.
Regardless, humans should want a cooler Earth, not a hotter one.
That&rsquo;s what our ancestors evolved and adapted to.

<p>
When we compare how much the culture war or social issues affect people versus how much climate change affects people, in most cases, most people feel more affected by cultural issues.
Hence, why they tend to care about social issues more.
Most people live in air-conditioned houses and buildings, while they also still have sufficient water and such.
So most people don&rsquo;t have to feel most of the effects of climate change as strongly, even if heat waves are becoming more common.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>People are more worried about climate change because they can feel the effects of climate change more directly, even though it is difficult to predict precisely how much climate change and global warming will occur every year.</li>
<li>On the other hand, the effects of overpopulation cannot be felt as immediately, and they can generally only be felt in the future all at once. A population grows and grows, until it doesn&rsquo;t (it crashes).
That&rsquo;s why the people are not concerned about overpopulation right now.</li>
</ul>


<p>
I used to believe that if we could just persuade say ~50% of the population and get the government on our side, then we would have sufficient political power for enforcing population control.
However, I no longer believe that anymore.
I took another black pill.
</p>

<p>
There are also other catastrophes awaiting us in the future that everybody knows about, but don&rsquo;t want to do anything about.
</p>

<p>
Many people (especially financial conservatives) know that the growing national debts must be paid back.
Even though everybody is aware that the national debt is a problem, most people don&rsquo;t want to do anything about it.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Boomers receive social security and are a powerful voting block. Democracy and welfare don&rsquo;t mix.
Even the most pragmatic politicians can&rsquo;t propose anything to reduce the debt, since they would lose voters, which could cost them their position in office.</li>
<li>Although the debt is rising and its interest is accumulating, nobody is feeling the economic consequences of the debt <i>right now</i>. Instead, most people are more concerned with distractions like the culture war, because it affects them in the present day.</li>
<li>Leftists aren&rsquo;t concerned with it because they want to increase government spending.
They also typically believe that they can and should be solved by &ldquo;taxing the rich&rdquo;. That won&rsquo;t work since most of the rich&rsquo;s assets cannot be liquidated and since the rich are too powerful to stop most tax increases anyway.</li>

<p>
The first attempts that people will do to address overpopulation will be similar to the attempts done to address climate change.
All these countries agree to these climate change agreements to lower the carbon emissions, but nobody follows the agreements and everybody backs out of what they said that they were going to because there is a tragedy of the common with regards to carbon emissions and such.
Instead of enforcing population control, everybody will be promoting ideas that could raise the carrying capacity

<p>
It will be like putting a bandage on a broken arm that is about to fall off or decay.
</p>


<p>
Humanity is much more likely to solve global warming and climate change than it is to solve overpopulation.
It might be possible for humanity to engineer its way out of climate change, even if it would be more ideal to pass government laws and regulations against global warming.
By comparison, most of the solutions for raising the carrying capacity are social problems.
There is some potential that humanity may solve some of those social limitations.
But even if we do, it won&rsquo;t be possible for humanity to engineer its way out of overpopulation.
Population control is the only way to solve overpopulation, without resorting to mass death.
</p>


<p>
It is generally accepted that the climate change is an ever increasing threat to humanity.
Some people even believe that it will be catastrophic.
Despite that, hardly any world governments have taken any major steps that will have substantial impact for preventing climate change or global warming from getting worse.
Unfortunately, this suggests that even if a significant portion of the population, the establishment, and the governments each recognize that overpopulation is going to be a problem for humanity, they <i>still</i> might not do anything about it.
</p>


<p>
One thing that worries me is that a lot people may decide to virtue-signal about overpopulation, without actually doing anything to raise the carrying capacity or the political will for enforcing population control.
<a href="#moralization">People already do this for climate change and many other environmental issues</a>.
Even though climate change is a real issue, this is the route that has been taken regarding it.

<p>
To be clear, our goal should be to solve <i>all</i> environmental issues, not just climate change.
</p>

<p>
If you&rsquo;re not part of the solution, then you&rsquo;re part of the problem.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Virtue signaling about climate change and environmentalism is not a solution to those problems.</li>
<li>Telling people to stop driving their car to work when they have no other viable ways to get to work or otherwise transport themselves around there is not a solution for reducing oil consumption.</li>
<li>Telling people to stop using palm oil is not a viable large-scale solution for reducing palm oil consumption.</li>
<li>Telling people to use more green energy is not a viable large-scale solution for reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, especially if the virtue-signalers are also against using more nuclear energy.</li>
<li>Telling people to buy and use electric vehicles is not a viable large-scale solution for reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. EVs still produce about half the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of traditional gasoline powered cars. EVs also require a lot of rare resources for producing their batteries. Promoting EVs is also ineffective if the public infrastructure (i.e. charging stations) aren&rsquo;t widely available. EVs have many tradeoffs to gasoline powered cars.</li>
<li>Educating people about climate change is important, but as we&rsquo;ve covered, <a href="#misidentified-phenomena">a lot of this &ldquo;education&rdquo; tends to wrongly attribute many problems and phenomena</a> to climate change.

</ul>

<p>
It&rsquo;s weird that it seems that a majority of climate activism is aimed towards consumers when it&rsquo;s actually the company who have most of the power regarding what resources and how much energy they use, and it&rsquo;s mainly up to the companies to change their ways for a more environmental future.
To a great extent, only governments can resolve these problems by placing restrictions on companies.
Educating consumers or activism towards the common people won&rsquo;t do much to change the government since most people ignore the world&rsquo;s big problems for distractions.

Most arguments against nuclear energy are appeals to emotion or fallible intuition.

Even though leftists (especially environmentalists) tend to be the most concerned about climate change, many or most of their proposals are ironically ineffective for preventing further climate change.

This ignores all the problems with EVs.
An electric car still produces half as much CO<sub>2</sub> as a gasoline-powered car since lots and lots of CO<sub>2</sub> is still produced during the manufacturing process.
That doesn&rsquo;t change much at all, especially when considering that the world population is still continuing to increase, which will further increase the demand for cars.

TL;DW: Infrastructure for EVs won&rsquo;t be built unless enough people have already bought EVs to make it profitable enough to do so, and people won&rsquo;t buy EVs unless there&rsquo;s enough infrastructure to support using them, so the cycle repeats.
Government is thus necessary to create the infrastructure to support EVs since the free market won&rsquo;t be able to solve this.

<p>
Not only that, but cobalt is necessary in order to build the batteries used inside electric cars.
China owns most of the world&rsquo;s cobalt mines, so increasing the number of electric vehicles in the West is guaranteed to increase the West&rsquo;s reliance on China, which would give China more geopolitical leverage to make the West do as it wants.

<h2 id="solutions"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Feasible Solutions to Climate Change</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-solutions">
<p>
My personal stance is that we can easily &ldquo;fight&rdquo; climate change without destabilizing the global economy with a few simple things:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Eliminate All <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel_subsidies">Fossil Fuel Subsidies</a>.</li>
<li>Implement Natural Resource Tax</li>
<li>Switch To Nuclear Energy</li>
<li>Stop Fighting Useless Wars</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thegwpf.org/content/uploads/2018/06/Save-the-oceans.pdf">Stop Recycling</a></li>
<li>Reduce Immigration From Developing Countries To Developed Countries</li>
<li>Gradually switch over to less car-centric urban planning and more efficient modes of transportation, like high-speed rail, or even walking/bicycles once cities become more closely built together.</li>
<li>Use the government to build more charging stations for EVs.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Those 3 things would result in an increase in costs for fossil fuels, but also significantly incentivize the switch to renewable energy and reduce taxpayer spending on pointless foreign affairs and energy subsidies (that just line the pockets of corporations who don&rsquo;t need the money). Gas, coal, and oil prices would go up, but we&rsquo;d be spending less money in taxes. The free market would cause a dramatic shift toward renewable energy.
</p>


<p>
Pollution taxes are the most effective way to prevent pollution.
</p>



<figure id="org603e2b7">
<img src="../images/CO2-emissions-saved-from-various-actions.png" alt="CO2-emissions-saved-from-various-actions.png">

</figure>

<p>
I&rsquo;m not opposed of taking the money we currently use to subsidize fossil fuels and put that money toward renewable energy subsidies instead, since it&rsquo;s still ultimately better than subsidizing oil corps, but my issue with all subsidies is that they ultimately end up lining the pockets of wealthy people and creating new billionaires.
As an individual, I can&rsquo;t take advantage of subsidies on solar panel manufacturing and energy storage, but Elon Musk sure can.
</p>

<p>
A fourth and controversial idea would be to allow individuals to sue corporations over pollution (which would effectively be implemented as a carbon tax and greenhouse gas tax).
If we somehow quantified the dollar-amount of damage caused by producing CO<sub>2</sub> and greenhouse gases and turned it into a zero-sum tax (penalize high polluters and refund low polluters), it would cause a huge market shift toward clean energy.
</p>

<p>
The big caveat here is that I unfortunately don&rsquo;t trust any world government to implement this fairly.
Corporate lobbying would result in loopholes that rich people can use to avoid the tax, while normal people are forced to pay, and the zero-sum implementation would never happen because governments can&rsquo;t be expected to pass up an opportunity for another revenue generator.
</p>

<p>
A shift toward reducing carbon output isn&rsquo;t a bad thing provided that the free market drives it.
In that scenario, the worst case is that we shift toward more sustainable energy sources &ldquo;all for nothing.&rdquo;

Proposals For Slowing Down The Rate Of Climate Change And Rising Sea Levels
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I do believe that the Earth is experiencing significant climate change due to human activity. I am undecided upon the possible consequences that climate change might pose to the incoming decades due to abundant amount of conflicting information and conflicts of interest (see the list) regarding the topic, but I also don&rsquo;t think that it could hurt to do what we can to prevent / slow down the rate of climate change and rising sea levels. I also acknowledge that thousands of inferential statistical models predicting the outcomes of climate change before the past few decades happened have turned out to be false and incorrect.</li>
<li>A lot of the things that could slow down the rate of climate change are things that we should be doing anyway:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Free Market Shifts To Renewable Energy that will happen automatically as the demand for non-renewable energy increases, thus increasing the cost of non-renewable energy and encouraging a natural economic shift towards renewable energy resources, especially since there is a finite amount of non-renewable energy resources.</li>
<li>Hybrid Automobiles, Less Plane Travels, and Less cruise ships to reduce the rate of pollution.</li>
<li>Reforestation Efforts to protect the biological diversity and the medical and environmental benefits that come with it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
More Proposals Regarding Climate Change
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Legalize prediction markets so we can get a clear, market-based prediction of the harms of climate change rather than indirect market assessments.</li>
<li>Legalize/deregulate assurance contracts and other financial instruments that would allow entrepreneurs to mitigate potential impact. This type of instrument could be used to fund either massive decarbonization or tech that mitigates impact.</li>
<li>Accept that the UN&rsquo;s estimates on climate change costs for impact of climate are at worst a few percent of world GDP. Continue to focus on economic growth, and if all of the above fails, reluctantly implement some sort of re-distributive Pigouvian taxation scheme to balance the cost of harms.</li>
<li>Realistically, I&rsquo;m not convinced climate change is a net harm (see David Friedman for more), even less so that it would be a harm to myself or my family, and even less so that the current international political apparatus could ever solve a problem of this type or scope. I&rsquo;d bet on innovators or entrepreneurs first.</li>

Someone&rsquo;s Commentary On A Carbon Tax
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Carbon emissions and the resulting climate effects seem to be an issue that libertarians should be upset about, and a carbon fee seems to be a solution compatible with libertarian thought.</li>
<li>The logic goes something like this:</li>
<li>The carbon-absorbing capacity of Earth&rsquo;s biosphere (without causing damage to people) is limited, and that resource is collectively owned by everyone.</li>
<li>People using a limited resource without compensating its owners are violating property rights.</li>
<li>The current $0 price on this resource, combined with the inability for people hurt by climate change to seek recompense for damages (because of distance in time and place) leads to its overuse</li>
<li>Price signals are how owners of a resource and people who want to use it communicate about scarcity and match supply and demand.</li>
<li>By putting a price on carbon emissions, in which people releasing CO<sub>2</sub> compensate the collective owners of the biosphere that must absorb it, we remedy the situation, restoring the ability of price signals to match demand to supply.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-global-government">
<p>
The most ideal solution to climate change would be to have a <a href="../civilization/political-philosophy#global-government">global government</a> that regulates how much CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gasses countries, companies, and people can release into the atmosphere.
Different countries likely have differing opinions on how the atmosphere should change since it would affect climates, crop types/growths, ocean depth levels (and thus affect coastal lands), and much more.
This is especially true since some countries actually mostly benefit from climate change, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KINGeP0f4lM">namely Russia and Canada</a>, and thus don&rsquo;t have the same incentives to limit their carbon emissions as other countries.
Regardless, a consensus could probably be reached on what should be done.
Once determined, the global government would enforce the solution on the world&rsquo;s countries, thus avoiding a tragedy of the commons.
</p>

<p>
Hopefully, legal pressure by the global government could incentive many countries to use more nuclear power.
<a href="#nuclear-energy-future">Nuclear energy is the best hope</a> for meeting humanity&rsquo;s future energy needs.
</p>


<p>
There have been international treaties for reducing climate change (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement">the Paris Climate Accords</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol">the Kyoto Protocol</a>, etc).
By contrast, there are no similarly notable international agreements for limiting fossil fuel consumption, pollution, deforestation, or population growth.
The climate change treaties haven&rsquo;t even been very effective.
Ratifying the Kyoto Protocol was optional for countries, so any country that doesn&rsquo;t want to get penalized for not reducing GHG emissions could simply choose to avoid ratifying it if they didn&rsquo;t want to get penalized.
<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement</a>
The Paris Agreement doesn&rsquo;t even have any mechanism for enforcing targets or holding signatories accountable.
Under an effective global government, all countries would have to obey the laws set by the government, or they will be punished.

<a href="https://whatisnuclear.com/">What Is Nuclear Energy?</a> is a website maintained by a group of nuclear engineers that aim to educate the advantages and drawbacks of nuclear energy.
It explains almost everything that you could want to know about nuclear energy.
</p>

<p>
Nuclear energy is a clean source of abundant, reliable energy that produces no carbon emissions.
</p>


<p>
NOTE: In order for the future of energy to be guaranteed to be reliant on nuclear energy, it would have to be decisively proven that there will be an everlasting or near-everlasting supply of nuclear matter that we can use to derive said nuclear energy.
</p>

<p>
IMPORTANT: Even if the Earth does have enough nuclear material to sustain the Earth for 1 billion years with nuclear energy, we have to recall that a lot of that nuclear material isn&rsquo;t necessarily within Western or Western-aligned territory.
A lot of it is in places like Niger, Russia, etc.
So, if the Earth is to switch to nuclear power as a long-term energy source, then ideally, we should first create a global government to manage the Earth&rsquo;s resources across <i>all</i> countries, not just some but not others.

IMPORTANT: There is however a major issue with nuclear energy:
Nuclear energy solutions require a degree of sophistication to maintain them properly. as our societies decline in cognitive ability due to the current trends&#x2026; it makes me speculate as to if we could properly maintain this.

Another problem is if there&rsquo;s a decline in predictable conditions under which to safely operate nuclear reactors.

Nine Energy Myths To Address:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Myth 1: Solar and wind power are the best ways of lowering emissions.</li>
<li>Myth 2: The world is transitioning to solar, wind, and batteries.</li>
<li>Myth 3: Solar farms reduce household utility bills.</li>
<li>Myth 4: Nuclear power is dangerous.</li>
<li>Myth 5: Nuclear waste is a big problem.</li>
<li>Myth 6: Electric vehicles reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</li>
<li>Myth 7: Climate risk is the biggest threat to developing countries.</li>
<li>Myth 8: Countries honor their climate pledges.</li>
<li>Myth 9: More energy consumption is bad.</li>
</ul>


<p>
A potential problem with increasing the production of nuclear energy around the world is that it could be a gateway for many countries to start acquiring nuclear weapons, if they haven&rsquo;t already done so.
Question: But is this an actual threat? Is it actually possible for creating nuclear power plants to be a stepping stone to acquiring nuclear energy, and have any countries ever actually done this?
</p>


<p>
Chernobyl did irreparable damage to the public&rsquo;s perception of nuclear energy.
It turned people off from nuclear energy and ensured that Europe would continue being dependent on the latest strongman from that area of the world (Russia) for energy.
</p>



<p>
It does require storing nuclear waste in places where it can remain permanently, and it can have occasional nuclear accidents, but those are both becoming less of problems over time as we figure out better solutions and safer technologies.
</p>

<p>
Yet another example showing why the current government policies of subsidizing electric vehicles (EVs) via tax credits don&rsquo;t work: <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2022/08/15/ford-f150-lightning-price-increases/">Ford Raises Electric Truck Price By Up To $8,500 After Democrats Pass $7,500 EV Tax Credit</a>.

TL;DR: Worrying about the dangers of nuclear power is actually costing more lives than it saves, due to rising CO2 levels and the consequences.

<p>
The main key to reversing climate change is to reduce the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere.
In the absence of effective action for doing this, the next best solution to global warming is to alter the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere to block out more heat and sunlight, which would lower the global temperature to counter the rising temperatures of recent decades.
Without a <a href="../civilization/political-philosophy#global-government">global government</a>, any attempt to do things like climate pledges will succumb to a global Tragedy of the Commons.
That&rsquo;s why the best solution we have with the current state of world affairs is to block slightly more sunlight out of the atmosphere, since it could reduce global warming, while having far less pressing game-theoretical dilemmas regarding its implementation (if any).
There might be a potential game-theoretical dilemma if countries don&rsquo;t consent to other countries modifying the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere.
But I suspect that dissenters would be increasingly less opposed to this idea as climate change continues to get worse and worse without any other reliable, foreseeable options.

&gt; Time to query the server on its positions on climate change. Real? Fake? Exaggerated? Understated?
Limiting the size of the population would allow us to free up some land for dense forests to grow, which would recapture some of the atmospheric C0<sub>2</sub>.
At this point I doubt anything else could make a dent in it.
Maybe encouraging the use of wood as a building material, idk.
It comes with other problems, and I don&rsquo;t know how that would scale, but it&rsquo;s another way to store carbon.

A similar idea is that humanity could figure out a way to filter high levels of CO<sub>2</sub> out of the atmosphere and figure out a way to store it somewhere else.
I don&rsquo;t know how technologically feasible it would be, but I suspect that it would be harder than making the atmosphere block out or reflect more heat from the Sun.
If humanity was storing all the excess CO<sub>2</sub> into wood, then popularizing wooden furniture and other wooden structures might be a practical norm.
</p>

<p>
We will have to be careful about this since technology in general is unpredictable and this technology has never been tried before, but if we don&rsquo;t do this, the Earth&rsquo;s climate and environment is going to continue to negatively change to the detriment of us humans and all other living species.
Fortunately though, we have observed the historical effects of how sending tons of volcanic ash into the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere can cause global temperatures to drop by blocking out sunlight, so we at least have some idea of how to go about this and some of the possible outcomes.
</p>

<p>
Although this proposal would end (or even reverse) global warming, it might not completely prevent climate and environmental change.
One example is that coral reefs would still be harmed by the increased acidity of the ocean water since the quantity of carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere and oceans would continue to increase (although they would still benefit from global temperatures no longer increasing or even decreasing).
Pollution taxes (a carbon tax in this case) would still be reasonable, even if the atmosphere was altered to block out more sunlight.
Developed countries that have already emitted a lot of carbon dioxide should be taxed more since they&rsquo;ve already made up their share for causing climate change.

Hypothetically, one could dump some substances into the Marianna Trench in powder form that would sink all the way down and would especially well bind a whole lot of the CO<sub>2</sub> that it&rsquo;d sink past in the process of reaching the bottom, in order to take CO<sub>2</sub> out of the upper layers of oceans that way.
A mass-produced substance or chemical for accomplishing this must have: 1. exceptionally high surface-area like dust or powder, and 2. is heavier than water to sink down, and 3. could bind more CO<sub>2</sub> in the process of sinking down, similar to those CO<sub>2</sub>-filtering methods to get it out of the air like in&#x2026; Iceland or so.
</p>

<p>
Here&rsquo;d be an idea for you to play around with in terms of thinking about if it could be useful.
It would need to avoid triggering other effects like algae blooms or affecting masses of fish, but near the (ant-)arctics or some places surely would provide suitable spot where it wouldn&rsquo;t interfere with the oceanic biosphere.
If it works efficiently enough, it may save a few trillions or so.

&ldquo;Based on the titration method, the storage capacity of CO<sub>2</sub> in both pure water and DSW was found to be 1.7 and 1.53 mmol/l, respectively, at ambient temperature (15 °C) and ambient pressure.
DSW water was found to contain 1.6 Ca wt% and 4.3 wt% Mg based on AAS analysis&rdquo;.

&gt; The objective of this research was to determine if DSW can sequester CO<sub>2</sub>.
&gt; The results from the experimental work indicate that significant carbonation does occur via injection of CO<sub>2</sub> at high pressure in DSW.
&gt; The pH of DSW dropped when CO<sub>2</sub>(g) was injected. The storage capacity of CO<sub>2</sub> in both pure water and DSW was found to be 1.7 and 1.53 mmol/l at ambient temperature (15 °C) and pressure 1 bar as determined by titration, this value could be higher if considering formation of NaHCO3(aq) as evident.
