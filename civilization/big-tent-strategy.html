It should be recognized that although revolutionaries of small nascent movements usually want to start being radical from the very beginning, they often start off by downplaying their ambitions and forming Big Tent coalitions because they have to. When they&rsquo;re downplaying their ambitions, essentially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motte-and-bailey_fallacy">Motte-and-Baileying</a> everybody on what they really want to do. Unless they start off as a Big Tent, they will otherwise be too small to actually change anything and make stuff happen. Once the revolutionaries become big enough to the point where they don&rsquo;t have to rely on being coalition movements anymore, they transition towards their extremist ulterior motives because that was the plan all along. The only purpose served by the Big Tent was to gain the momentum necessary for accomplishing that.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-nazis" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="nazis"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> The Nazis Gained Power By Being Moderate, And Then Radicalizing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-nazis">
<p>
A notable historical example is how the Nazis attempted a revolutionary strategy when they attempted to overthrow the government during the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. The revolutionary approach had failed, so they decided to obtain power via reformist and legal means instead. In the May 1928 federal election, they only achieved 2.6% of the vote, but then they formed a temporary alliance with the larger and less extremist German National People&rsquo;s Party (DNVP). This alliance (as well as the onset of the Great Depression and other things) contributed to weakening the DNVP&rsquo;s share of the vote in the September 1930 election to 7%, while boosting the Nazis to win 18.2% of the vote that same year. By temporarily using a moderated Big Tent approach, the Nazis gained the propulsion that they needed to seize power and start radicalizing towards their true ambitions.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmabteilung#Night_of_the_Long_Knives">Wikipedia Excerpt about how Ernst Röhm wanted to create an even more radical version of the Nazi Party, which was one reason why Hitler purged him and other members of the Sturmabteilung</a>
</p>

<p>
After their victory in the 1933 election, some of the Nazis were plotting to create an even more radical version of the Nazi Party that would seize power via a coup d&rsquo;état and start a war. Hitler would not allow this though, so he ordered the assassination of Ernst Röhm in order to maintain his grip on power. It&rsquo;s possible that might have prevented the Nazis from starting WWII on an earlier date, and if that&rsquo;s true, then taking a moderate position on politics for the time being while gradually escalating was a smart move for the Nazis.

<div id="outline-container-ancaps" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="ancaps"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Ancaps Who Have To Be Big Tent To Appeal To Moderate Libertarians</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-ancaps">
<p>
A second example: When I used to be an Ancap in college, the club president (also an Ancap) and I (the vice president) were trying to recruit Libertarians to join the Libertarian chapter on our college campus. We both agreed that if our club ever did get big enough, we were going to transition it away from being a Libertarian club to being an Ancap / Voluntaryist club. Although we both wanted to start an Anarchist club from the beginning, there&rsquo;s no chance that ever would&rsquo;ve gained much traction because that would&rsquo;ve been too extremist for anybody to ever consider joining, so we had to settle for a moderate Libertarian club that was open to anybody and hope that it would recruit enough members and transition towards being an Anarcho-Capitalist club instead. We actually gathered a couple dozen members, but eventually I left the club after I rejected Anarchism and Libertarianism. I don&rsquo;t know what happened to it after that.

<h2 id="efilists"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Efilists Who Have To Be Big Tent In Order To Appeal To Anti-Natalists</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-efilists">
<p>
A third example of this would be how Amanda Sukenick and other Efilists are trying to co-opt the much much larger Anti-Natalism movement and &ldquo;Efilize the Anti-Natalism movement from within&rdquo;, in an effort to recruit more potential Efilists. If the Efilism movement ever grows large enough, Sukenick is definitely going to stop promoting Anti-Natalist activism and start pushing Efilist activism instead. She has said all this on video.

<div id="outline-container-political-factions" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="political-factions"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Political Factions That Have To Work Within A More Moderate Coalition</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-political-factions">
<p>
All political factions that are apart of a larger, more moderate coalition are also using the Big Tent Strategy to gain power and achieve some of their objectives, even though it requires sacrificing their more radical yearnings. Every faction in the coalition is only part of the coalition for convenience, and if any of the factions see an opportunity to persuade, influence, or manipulate the others towards their cause, they&rsquo;ll readily do so. Whenever a bunch of factions unite together to form a coalition, each faction is hoping to eventually out-compete the other factions for control of the entire coalition once the coalition&rsquo;s goal is finished.

<div id="outline-container-religious-branches" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="religious-branches"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> All The World&rsquo;s Major Religions Evolved Into Various Different Branches</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-religious-branches">
<p>
Religions (and ideologies in general) have a tendency to branch off into different subgroups over time.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Judaism branched off into Christianity, which branched off into Catholicism, Eastern Orthodox, Protestantism, Coptic Orthodox, Ethiopian Orthodox, Mormonism, Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses, Christian Scientism, Seventh Day Adventists, etc.</li>
<li>Islam branched off into Sunni Islam, Shiism, Ibadi Islam, etc.</li>
<li>Hinduism branched into many different local beliefs.</li>
<li>Buddhism branched into Theravada, Mahayana, Vajrayana Buddhism.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In a sense, each one of these major world religions can be considered a big tent of sorts, especially from the perspectives of outsiders. But internally within each tent, some (perhaps most) of the people in each of the different sects don&rsquo;t see members of the other sects as belonging to the same religion. For instance, many Sunni Muslims don&rsquo;t consider Shiite Muslims to be true Muslims and view them as belonging to an entirely different religion. The same goes for how Catholics often view Protestants, how Christians often view Mormons or Jehovah&rsquo;s Witnesses, and so on. Just like every big tent, there are different factions inside the tent that gatekeep and insist that the other factions under the tent are not true believers. On the other hand, outsiders that oppose the big tent movements in question will tend to view and treat all the factions of the tent as belonging to the same ideology, as outsiders are less likely to understand what makes each of the different factions different from each other.
</p>

<p>
Ideologies need labels in order to propagate effectively since labels define the &ldquo;in-group&rdquo; and the &ldquo;out-group&rdquo;. Being able to identify with an already established label can help an ideology propagate better (as opposed to a newly made-up label), which may help to explain why Shiites are likely to identify themselves as legitimate Muslims and why Protestants view their religion as having more similarities than differences to Catholicism, even though Shiism and Protestantism both branched off an already established religion whose members are more likely to see the new movements as being heresy.

<h2 id="final-thoughts"><span class="section-number-2">7.</span> Final Thoughts</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-final-thoughts">
<p>
When a big tent movement arises, it&rsquo;s pretty typical for the tent&rsquo;s ideology and ideals to evolve over time or get watered down, especially if it propagates to many different peoples in high numbers. The bigger the tent, the more likely some faction and/or another is going to diverge into a distinctly different ideology that only has veins of similarity to the original big tent. At the same time however, a lot of what enables a successful big tent movement to propagate effectively comes from its number of members. Big Tents are best at accomplishing short-term coalition goals and propagating core ideas to a somewhat wider range of people, but they will always have the downside that the perceived differences between the tent&rsquo;s members will come to outweigh their similarities and cause the tent to evolve, diverge, or fall apart entirely.
