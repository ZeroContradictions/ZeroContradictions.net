            <img src="images/ZC-emblem.svg" alt="Zero Contradictions">
            Hello and welcome to my philosophy website. My name is Zero Contradictions, and this place is a hybrid between a blog for my philosophical writings <span style="color:red">(highlighted in red)</span> and a compendium of external links to works by different authors that have influenced my own philosophy and/or are worth reading <span style="color:blue">(highlighted in blue)</span> as well as links to videos, channels, or audio recordings <span style="color:green">(highlighted in green)</span>. If you click one of the links in the navigation bar, then the page will scroll down to that section, which will be in one of the three columns. As per its name, the goal of this website is to create the best philosophy ever with Zero Contradictions, or to at least do my best at that. In a single sentence, my philosophy is based on rationalism and understanding the implications of the subject-object dichotomy and applied evolutionary theory, among other things.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: Many the red link posts written by myself could be expanded, but I'm publishing what I have already written for now for others to read if they'd like. Everything on this website is under copyright, unless specified otherwise. If you want to report any typos or broken links, to ask questions, to give constructive criticism, to suggest some links to add to this home page, or to make a donation, please reach out to me at <a class="ZC-essays" href="misc/contact#contact-ZC">my contact page</a>.

        <p>Everything that was thought impossible, but was possible, only seemed impossible until it actually happened. The same applies to Overpopulation and Neo-Malthusianism.</p></li>
    <li><a class="ZC-essays" href="FAQs/EPC-FAQs">EPC And Reproduction Licenses FAQs</a>
        <p>Licenses are required to adopt children, so what's wrong with requiring licenses to have biological children? Requiring a license to have children is the simplest, most practical, and least authoritarian solution to reestablish positive selective pressures on the human genome.</p></li>
    <li><a class="ZC-essays" href="FAQs/race-FAQs">Philosophy of Race FAQs</a>
        <p>Addressing the common misconceptions and implications of race, race realism, race-mixing, and ethnostates from a biological realist perspective. Race realism is a scientific position that acknowledges evolutionary differences and does not imply racism nor tribalism.</p></li>
    <li><a class="ZC-essays" href="FAQs/georgism-FAQs">Georgism FAQs</a>
        <p>Explaining the following and so much more: Addressing the problems, technicalities, and theoretical implementation of Georgism, why Georgism would solve the tragedy of the commons, why there would still be incentives to improve property even if natural resources are owned to everybody, etc.</p></li>

    <li><a class="ZC-essays" href="civilization/case-against-libertarianism">The Case Against Libertarianism and Anarchism</a>
        <p>Libertarianism is unsustainable, incompatible with human nature, and it fails to understand what freedom is and why/when it's desirable.</p></li>
    <li><a class="ZC-essays" href="misc/critique-of-objectivism">The Problems With Ayn Rand's Objectivism</a>
        <p>Objectivism faces the same problems that most philosophies do: it neglects the implications of the subject-object dichotomy, as well as the implications that evolution, biology, and game-theory have for humanity.</p></li>
    <li><a class="ZC-essays" href="FAQs/website-glossary">Website Glossary And Neologisms</a>
        <p>This page lists a glossary of terms that are commonly used on this website. The invention of new words for specific concepts leads to faster neurological retrieval of those concepts, and should cause this blog to gain more publicity and notoriety.</p></li>

        <p>I haven't read this book, and I am somewhat skeptical of it since the author has a Libertarian bias. Nevertheless, this book talks about how slavery was abolished in various different countries, and it argues that there were other factors besides technological ones for why slavery ended.</p></li>

        <p>Everyone thinks inside a box, created by heuristics that our brains use to limit the complexity of thought; Why greater rationality correlates with greater individualism and free speech.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://expandingrationality.substack.com/p/the-modern-problems-with-conformity">The Modern Problems with Conformity</a>
        <p>Conformity was a good heuristic for survival and prosperity in the past. In the modern world, conformity is now an unreliable heuristic because most people have maladaptive behavior, people can choose which social circles they want to conform to, and we're constantly exposed to artificial media.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/07/circles-of-control-and-freedom.html">Circles of Control and Freedom</a>
        <p>Freedom only exists within a system of constraints: physical, biological, psychological, cultural and social.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/09/freedom-of-speech.html">Freedom of Speech and Why It is Important</a>
        <p>Freedom of speech exists to talk about controversial ideas from outside the Overton Window. This it is necessary for the best ideas to flourish. Any use of coercion, whether it be by the state, corporations, mobs, or individuals to suppress ideas is an attack on freedom of speech.</p></li>

        <p>The supply of good ideas is likely finite. Once all the good ideas have already been claimed and published, i.e. humans have passed Peak Idea Production, there aren't many good ideas left to discover.<p></li>

        <p>This essay describes how evolutionary mismatch and the abundance of information and art in the modern world have created a new environment in which humans pursue entertainment and behaviors that simulate the emotional responses of their ancestral environment, due to being emotionally detached (alienated) from reality.</p></li>

        <p>The counter-culture of the sixties was the result of the baby-boomers search for meaning after growing up in a stable, predictable environment everyday for years. The big problems of existence were relegated to obscurity again, handed back to the philosophers and the poets, and people went on with their lives.</p></li>

        <p>From a purely biological perspective, Feminism is a memetic disease that denies biological realities and decreases reproductive success. Feminism does not demand true equality of outcomes between the sexes (the West has already achieved that). Instead, it is a <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-communists-who-took-power-in.html">utopian ideology</a> that women can use to claim power, social status, moral superiority, and moral credit as oppressed victims.</p></li>

        <p>A Classic Tactic used by Utopian Ideologists to replace rationalist thinking with rhetoric and self-righteous nonsense. The key is to use selective metaphors and phrases and portray the "oppressors" as having agency and the "victims" as having no agency.</p></li>

<h2 id="bio-realism">Understanding Biological Realism and Evolution</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p>This section contains a list of essays by Blithering Genius about Biological Realism and Evolution, which I consider to be the best material there is on the Internet for fully understanding Evolution.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPXJ85W7">Debunking the Selfish Gene by T. K. Van Allen</a>
        <p>This book debunks the Richard Dawkins' concept of the selfish gene, which situates biological purpose in genes, rather than the organism as a whole. The author presents an alternative theory of biological purpose that is more consistent with the evidence: the phenocentric view.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html">Life is Intrinsically Violent</a> | <a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJoadX31wZo">Video Version</a>
        <p>Violence is inescapable from life due to the war, disease, and famine that are inevitably caused when a population reaches its carrying capacity. Eliminating violence within a society simply pushes the violence outwards. </p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/04/altruism-and-selfishness.html">Why Selfishness Always Beats Altruism</a> | <a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QoiEMN-dBY">Video Version</a>
        <p>People will use and define "altruism" and "selfishness" in confusing ways, but the most coherent definition of "altruism" always loses to the most coherent definition of "selfishness", energetically, biologically, and psychologically.</p></li>

    <!-- <li><a class="videos" href="https://odysee.com/@BlitheringGenius:2/BiologicalRealism:b">Biological Realism</a> -->
    <!--     <p>The five main components of biological realism that most people tend to ignore nowadays are: the intrinsic violence and selfishness of life, sex realism, race realism, dysgenics/eugenics, and social/psychological realism.</p></li> -->
    <li><a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K97OP2p9JTQ">Pathological Altruism</a> | <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2016/12/pathological-altruism.html">Text Version</a>
        <p>Pathological Altruism is a phenomenon of collective irrationality caused by social delusion, and a virtue-signaling tragedy of the commons.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/01/rk-selection-theory-is-bogus.html">Understanding Evolutionary Reasoning and why r/K Selection Theory is Bogus</a>
        <p>r/K Selection Theory is fallacious and has no explanatory power. The second half of this essay gives a great explanation of how evolution actually works.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/07/kin-selection-theory-is-wrong.html">Why Kin Selection Theory is Wrong</a>
        <p>There is very little evidence of kin altruism in nature, other than parental care of offspring. Kin Altruism is a myth used to justify utopian ideologies.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/02/we-cannot-transcend-evolution.html"> We Cannot Transcend Evolution</a> | <a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gqtu8_LmsoQ">Video Version</a>
        <p>We can never escape from the evolutionary process that creates and maintains the human form. We can change the environment in which this process operates, but we cannot escape from the process itself.</p></li>

        <p>Evolution creates reproducing machines, not entities with genetic interests. Cooperating with others can create a bigger machine (a society) that benefits its members, but every individual's participation in that machine is conditional and selfish, not an expression of a greater purpose. Racial tribalism does not fit the biological or historical evidence.</p></li>

A lot of fake research occurs in the West due to the denial of biological realities.</p></li>

        <p>The moral framework of altruism does not lead to actual altruism. It leads to individuals seeking power through victimhood and eventual social collapse.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/09/morality-and-bad-faith.html">Morality and Bad Faith</a>
        <p>Morality generates a complex web of pretense, deception, and delusion, for both individuals and collectives. This resulting bad faith prevents us from understanding and speaking the truth about nature, society, human nature, and our own motivations.</p></li>

        <p>Nazism is usually presented as a negative moral exemplar without any rational analysis. This essay analyzes and critiques the Nazi worldview from a "Darwinian" perspective, as well as the popular moral narrative about the Nazis and WWII.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/06/efilism.html">Blithering Genius's Critique of Efilism</a>
        <p>In summary, Efilism relies on four assumptions: hedonism, altruism, assymetry of pain and pleasure, and life is violent.</p></li>

        <p>Adam Lanza's secret Youtube channel revealed his intentions. His personal philosophy (Euvalism, value spelled backwards) had similarities to Efilism, Antinatalism, and Anarcho-Primitivism, but it was also uniquely different, and emphasized a hatred for culture. Eventually he chose to free himself from having values via his own death.</p></li>
