        <p>
            <img src="images/georgism-flag-1.jpg" alt="Zero Contradictions">
            Hello and welcome to my philosophy website. My name is Zero Contradictions, and this place is a hybrid between a blog for my philosophical writings <font color="red">(highlighted in red)</font> and a compendium of external links to works by different authors that have influenced my own philosophy and/or are worth reading <font color="blue">(highlighted in blue)</font> as well as links to videos, channels, or audio recordings <font color="green">(highlighted in green)</font>. If you click one of the links in the navigation bar, then the page will scroll down to that section, which will be in one of the three columns.
            <br><br>
            As per its name, the goal of this website is to create the best philosophy ever with Zero Contradictions, or to at least do my best at that. The Modern World has reached an unprecedented level of insanity due to immense evolutionary mismatch caused by the Industrial Revolution and incoherent moral values, and it is now more important than ever to get the philosophical grounding necessary for solving the problems set before us. It is very <a class="ZC-essays" href= "epistemology/difficult-to-change-peoples-minds.html">difficult to change many people's minds</a>, but that is no reason not to try.
            <br><br>
            NOTE: As of early 2023, the vast majority of the red link posts written by myself are unfinished and have sections that need further elaboration, but I'm publishing what I have already written for now for others to read if they'd like. Everything on this website is under copyright, unless specified otherwise. If you want to report any typos or broken links, to ask questions, to give constructive criticism, to suggest some links to add to this home page, or to make a donation, please reach out to me at <a class="ZC-essays" href="meta/contact.html#contact-ZC">my contact page</a>.

        <p>Freedom of speech exists to talk about controversial ideas from outside the Overton Window. This it is necessary for the best ideas to flourish.

        <p>From a purely biological perspective, Feminism is a memetic disease that denies biological realities and decreases reproductive success. Feminism does not demand true equality of outcomes between the sexes (the West has already achieved that). Instead, it is a <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-communists-who-took-power-in.html?view=classic">utopian ideology</a> that women can use to claim power, social status, moral superiority, and moral credit as oppressed victims.</p></li>

<h2 id="bio-realism">Understanding Biological Realism and Evolution</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p>This section contains a list of essays by Blithering Genius about Biological Realism and Evolution, which I consider to be the best material there is on the Internet for fully understanding Evolution.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPXJ85W7">Debunking the Selfish Gene by T. K. Van Allen</a>
        <p>This book debunks the Richard Dawkins' concept of the selfish gene, which situates biological purpose in genes, rather than the organism as a whole. The author also presents an alternative theory of biological purpose: the phenocentric view.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html?view=classic">Life is Intrinsically Violent</a>
        <p>Violence is inescapable from life due to the war, disease, and famine that are inevitably caused when a population reaches its carrying capacity. Eliminating violence within a society simply pushes the violence outwards.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/04/altruism-and-selfishness.html?view=classic">Why Selfishness Always Beats Altruism</a>
        <p>People will use and define "altruism" and "selfishness" in confusing ways, but the most coherent definition of "altruism" always loses to the most coherent definition of "selfishness", energetically, biologically, and psychologically.</p></li>
    <!-- <li><a class="videos" href="https://odysee.com/@BlitheringGenius:2/BiologicalRealism:b">Biological Realism</a> -->
    <!--     <p>The five main components of biological realism that most people tend to ignore nowadays are: the intrinsic violence and selfishness of life, sex realism, race realism, dysgenics/eugenics, and social/psychological realism.</p></li> -->
    <li><a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K97OP2p9JTQ">Pathological Altruism</a>
        <p>Pathological Altruism is a phenomenon of collective irrationality caused by social delusion, and a virtue-signaling tragedy of the commons.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/01/rk-selection-theory-is-bogus.html?view=classic">Understanding Evolutionary Reasoning and why r/K Selection Theory is Bogus</a>
        <p>r/K Selection Theory is fallacious and has no explanatory power. The second half of this essay gives a great explanation of how evolution actually works.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/07/kin-selection-theory-is-wrong.html?view=classic">Why Kin Selection Theory is Wrong</a>
        <p>There is very little evidence of kin altruism in nature, other than parental care of offspring. Kin Altruism is a myth used to justify utopian ideologies.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/02/we-cannot-transcend-evolution.html?view=classic"> We Cannot Transcend Evolution</a>
        <p>We can never escape from the evolutionary process that creates and maintains the human form. We can change the environment in which this process operates, but we cannot escape from the process itself.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/04/bees-are-not-social.html?view=classic">Bees are not Social, Debunking Altruism Myths, and the Organism Unit of Selection</a>
        <p>An insight into bee biology. Moreover, bees are not altruistic, and the primary unit of selection for bees is the Queen since all genes flow through her.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/12/the-balance-of-nature.html?view=classic">The Balance of Nature</a>
        <p>Ecosystems and organisms always tend towards evolutionary stable states.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/10/competition-in-nature.html?view=classic">Competition in Nature</a>
        <p>Competition in Nature exists between individuals, types/populations, genes/traits, and social groups. This essay talks about each of them.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/12/god-is-telomeme.html?view=classic">A Framework for Memetic Theory</a>
        <p>Memes can be divided into Traditions and Fashions / Cults, based on how they usually spread from one person to another.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/11/adaptive-coherence.html?view=classic">Adaptive Coherence</a>
        <p>Genes and memes work together hand-in-hand, and different biologies will produce different kinds of societies.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/04/family-and-society.html?view=classic">Family, Transfers of Energy, and Exchanges of Labor</a>
