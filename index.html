		Hello and welcome to my philosophy website.
		My name is Zero Contradictions, and this place is a hybrid between a blog for my own writings <span style="color:#EE0534">(highlighted in red)</span> and a compendium of external links to works by different authors that have influenced my own philosophy and/or are worth reading <span style="color:#015EF4">(highlighted in blue)</span> as well as links to videos, channels, or audio recordings <span style="color:#009C00">(highlighted in green)</span>.
		If you click one of the links in the navigation bar, then the page will scroll down to that section (which will be in one of the three columns for displays that are at least 800 pixels wide).
		<br>
		<a class="ZC-essays" href="directory">The directory page</a> only displays essays that I wrote myself, hence why it has almost no blue or green links.
		Everything on this website is under copyright, unless specified otherwise.
		<br>
		If you want to report any typos or broken links, ask questions, give constructive criticism, make volunteer translations, suggest links to add to this home page, or make a donation, please reach out to me at <a class="ZC-essays" href="misc/contact#contact-ZC">my contact page</a>.
		As per its name, the goal of this website is to create the most rational philosophy ever with Zero Contradictions, or to at least do my best at that.
		In a single sentence, my philosophy is based on rationalism and understanding the implications of the subject-object dichotomy and applied evolutionary theory, among other things.

<ul>
	<li>This section mostly contains a list of essays by Blithering Genius about Biological Realism and Evolution, which I consider to be the best material in the world for fully understanding Evolution and its implications.</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPXJ85W7">Debunking the Selfish Gene by T. K. Van Allen</a> | <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/11/debunking-selfish-gene.html">Book Summary</a>
		<p>This book debunks the Richard Dawkins' concept of the selfish gene, which situates biological purpose in genes, rather than the organism as a whole. The author presents an alternative theory of biological purpose that is more consistent with the evidence: the phenocentric view.</p></li>
	<li><a class="videos" href="https://odysee.com/@BlitheringGenius:2/BiologicalRealism:b">Biological Realism</a> | <a class="ZC-essays" href="faqs/morality#biorealism">Text Summary</a>
		<p>People ignore many aspects of human biology nowadays for moral reasons: the inherit violence and selfishness of life, sex realism, race realism, dysgenics/eugenics, and social/psychological realism. Most ideologies are therefore incongruent with reality.</p></li>
	<li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/09/life-is-violent.html">Life is Violent</a> | <a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJoadX31wZo">Video Version</a>
		<p>Violence is inescapable from life due to the war, disease, and famine that are inevitably caused when a population reaches its carrying capacity. Eliminating violence within a society simply pushes the violence outwards. </p></li>
	<li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/04/altruism-and-selfishness.html">Altruism and Selfishness</a> | <a href="pdfs/altruism-and-selfishness.pdf">PDF Version</a> | <a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QoiEMN-dBY">Video Version</a>
		<p>People will use and define "altruism" and "selfishness" in confusing ways, but the most coherent definition of "altruism" always loses to the most coherent definition of "selfishness", energetically, biologically, and psychologically.</p></li>
	<li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/07/kin-selection-theory-is-wrong.html">Why Kin Selection Theory is Wrong</a> | <a href="pdfs/kin-selection-theory-is-wrong.pdf">PDF Version</a>
		<p>There is little evidence of kin altruism in nature, other than parental care of offspring. Altruism between siblings is better explained by the extended phenotype. There are multiple problem with Hamilton's Rule, such as the free-rider problem. Kin Altruism is a myth used to justify collectivist ideologies.</p></li>
	<li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/04/bees-are-not-social.html">Bees Are Not Social</a>
		<p>Explaining how bee reproduction works. Bees are not altruistic, and the primary unit of selection for bees is the Queen since all genes flow through her. Beehives are multi-body organisms.</p></li>

		<p>Pathological Altruism is a phenomenon of collective irrationality caused by social delusion, and a virtue-signaling tragedy of the commons.</p></li>

		<p>Ecosystems and organisms always tend towards <del>evolutionary stable states</del> selective equilibria. Selective equilibrium can only be achieve when life forms are competing for resources against other life forms. Interactions between different life forms in an ecosystem can be positive or negative, but negative interactions are what ultimately limit populations. Life is easy only when an ecosystem is (temporarily) out of balance.</p></li>

		<p>Sex, death, and complexity are all linked. Death is a consequence of entropy and evolution. The dynamics of sexual reproduction force the cells of the body to work together, rather than competing against each other. This is arguably the most important reason why sexual reproduction evolved.</p></li>

		<p>Evolution creates reproducing machines, not entities with genetic interests. Cooperating with others can create a bigger machine (a society) that benefits its members, but every individual's participation in that machine is conditional and selfish, not an expression of a greater purpose. Racial tribalism does not fit the biological or historical evidence.</p></li>

		<p>In general, if the mutations that cause infant morality generalize to other traits, then they should also be selected against in miscarriages/sperm/mating, which will cause their proliferation in the gene pool to decrease.
		If the genes do not generalize, then genes that cause infant mortality may increase due to a lack of purifying selection, but that will not generalize to intelligence and other traits.

		<p>The Ancestral Premature Death Rate (APDR) is useful as a mental shorthand because it captures several characteristics of a population. It is directly related to ancestral brood size, and it reflects the intensity of the selective pressure a species was under in the ancestral environment. As a consequence, it also determines the level of genetic noise we should expect in a population.</p></li>

There is a stabilizing feedback loop between meritocratic norms, genetic stratification, and genetic homogenization, and it's also affected by the fertility rates of the society's social classes.</p></li>

		<p>The 1960s were the main cultural turning point in the Modern West. The counter-culture was primarily a result of the baby-boomers' search for meaning after growing up in a stable, predictable environment everyday for years.

		<p>From a purely biological perspective, Feminism is a memetic disease that denies biological realities and decreases reproductive success. Feminism does not demand true equality of outcomes between the sexes (the West has already achieved that). Instead, it is a <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-communists-who-took-power-in.html">utopian ideology</a> that women can use to claim power, social status, moral superiority, and moral credit as oppressed victims.</p></li>

		<p>Freedom of speech is the principle that coercion should not be used to suppress ideas. It is necessary for social rationality. Freedom of speech is often censored by corporations, the academy, and lone individuals (e.g. doxxing, threats, etc). Politeness and tragedies of the commons can sometimes conflict with free speech, and the best resolution to these concerns is to have separate spaces with different rules.</p></li>

		<p>Technology and Progress have been largely stagnant over the past 50 years. We cannot transcend the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_condition">human condition</a>, and the biggest problems of the 21st century will be political and philosophical problems, not scientific nor technological ones.</p></li>

		<p>An aggressive business strategy combined with political influence is often enough to promote an inferior idea far beyond a good one. Over time an inferior idea may grow. Growth of that industry leads to more jobs reliant on the continuation of that idea. Society starts to defend and even fight just to continue inferior ideas in some cases.</p>

		<p>If modern civilization collapses, the fossil fuels that powered it will already be all used up, hence the necessary energy won't exist anymore to restart it. The scientific knowledge, technological complexity, social complexity, and economic complexity will all fall apart if that happens. Modern Civilization will never recover if it falls.</p></li>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2023/05/what-is-value.html">What is Value?</a> | <a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5UsqSgK04o">Closely Related Video</a>
		<p>There are four types of value. Biological value is what is good or bad for an organism. Psychological value is a mental judgment of what is good or bad for an individual, from their subjective perspective. Social value judgments are intersubjective. And philosophical value is defined by an explicit philosophical theory of value.</p></li>

		<p>You can't rebel against your own nature, even if you reject it philosophically. You might arrive at the philosophical position that life is meaningless, but you won't act as if life is meaningless.</p></li>

		<p>Family is based on love, society is based on cooperation between selfish individuals, nature is governed by evolution, and the cosmos are governed by entropy and causality. When people encounter a bigger circle, they often struggle with it and may reject it as immoral.</p></li>
	<li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2022/02/motivation.html">Motivation, Pain, and Pleasure </a> | <a href="pdfs/motivation.pdf">PDF Version</a>
		<p>Emotions generate motivation, which generates action. Increasing pain corresponds to increasing motivation, and decreasing motivation correlates with increasing pleasure. We could call it <a href="https://brittonicmemetics.wordpress.com/2024/02/27/zero-sumness/">Zero-Sum Motivation Theory</a>. It has similarities with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_reduction_theory_(learning_theory)">Drive-Reduction Theory of Motivation</a>.</p></li>
	<li><a class="ZC-essays" href="epistemology/axiology">Axiology: The Nature of Value</a>
		<p>Axiology studies the nature, properties, rationality, judgment, and ranking of values. Axiology has implications for ethics, game theory, and political philosophy.</p></li>
	<li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2025/03/a-critique-of-utility.html">A Critique of "Utility"</a>
		<p>The concept of utility is sometimes a convenient yet fictitious idea for thinking about value. Upon closer examination however, there is no definition of utility that can coherently quantify, measure, compare, sum over a collection, exchange, produce, consume, etc objects or actions.</p></li>
	<li><a class="ZC-essays" href="epistemology/axiology#g-s-factors">g-Factors and s-Factors</a>

		<p>Morality is made up of collective values, individual internalization of said values, folk theory, and individual and collective moral myths and assumptions. "Objective Morality" is debunked as an oxymoron.</p></li>
	<li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2024/08/the-case-against-moral-realism.html">The Case Against Moral Realism</a> | <a href="pdfs/case-against-moral-realism.pdf">PDF Version</a>
		<p>Moral realism doesn't provide a coherent definition of good and evil. In most cases, moral disagreements cannot be resolved by rational persuasion, since moral judgments vary so much between individuals, cultures, and societies. Morality is ad hoc, and evil is pervasive.</p></li>

		<p>An ideology is a system of ideas that defines a social and moral dichotomy between <em>us</em> and <em>them</em>, <em>good</em> and <em>evil</em>. Everyone knows that the other group's ideology is crazy and that the other group is hypocritical, but they can't see those things about their own ideology and themselves.</p></li>

		<p>Every morally self-righteous person has what's called a Utopian Ideology, an unrealistic and tribalistic belief system that gives its adherents a claim to moral superiority and the illusion of knowledge. </p></li>
	<li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2018/11/the-lion-king-moral-narrative.html">The Lion King Moral Narrative</a>
		<p>Most moral narratives revolve around Us vs Them and Good vs Evil, used by people for justification of their ideologies since the narratives fit their social instincts and worldview conditioned by the media. They are similar to Walt Disney movies, like the Lion King.</p></li>
	<li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2014/01/altruistic-morality-and-victimhood.html">Altruistic Morality and Victimhood</a> | <a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxR4R2nfJV0">Video Version</a>
		<p>The moral framework of altruism does not lead to actual altruism. It leads to individuals seeking power through victimhood and eventual social collapse.</p></li>
	<li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/09/morality-and-bad-faith.html">Morality and Bad Faith</a>
		<p>Morality generates a complex web of pretense, deception, and delusion, for both individuals and collectives. This resulting bad faith prevents us from understanding and speaking the truth about nature, society, human nature, and our own motivations.</p></li>
	<li><a href="https://expandingrationality.substack.com/p/israel-palestine-and-moral-confusion">Israel, Palestine and Moral Confusion</a>
		<p>Moral judgements about events are made by subconsciously fitting the event to some moral pattern. Multiple moral patterns can be seen in the Israel-Palestine Conflict, and this creates moral confusion for nearly every political faction.</p></li>
	<li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/11/nazism.html">A Rational Analysis and Critique of Nazism</a> | <a href="pdfs/nazism.pdf">PDF Version</a>
		<p>Nazism is usually presented as a negative moral exemplar without any rational analysis. This essay analyzes and critiques the Nazi worldview from a "Darwinian" perspective, as well as the popular moral narrative about the Nazis and WWII.</p></li>

		<p>In summary, Efilism relies on four assumptions: hedonism, altruism, assymetry of pain and pleasure, and life is violent.</p></li>
	<li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2021/09/the-ghost-of-adam-lanza.html">The Ghost of Adam Lanza</a> | <a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMTqrHviBE0">Video Version</a>
		<p>Adam Lanza was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting">Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter</a>. His secret Youtube channel revealed his intentions when it was discovered in September 2021. His personal philosophy (Eulavism, value spelled backwards) had similarities to Efilism, Antinatalism, and Anarcho-Primitivism, but it was also uniquely different, and emphasized a hatred for culture.</p></li>
	<li><a class="ZC-essays" href="misc/case-against-efilism">The Case Against Efilism: Why Efilism Will Never Win</a>
		<p>Efilism is self-defeating and unlikely to succeed. The Efilist mindset is based on ignorance, rhetoric, and unquestioned assumptions like hedonism and altruism.</p></li>
