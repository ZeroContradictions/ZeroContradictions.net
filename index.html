        <p>
            <img src="images/ZC-emblem.svg" alt="Zero Contradictions Emblem">
Hello and welcome to my philosophy website. My name is Zero Contradictions, and this place is a hybrid between a blog for my own writings <span style="color:#EE0534">(highlighted in red)</span> and a compendium of external links to works by different authors that have influenced my own philosophy and/or are worth reading <span style="color:#015EF4">(highlighted in blue)</span> as well as links to videos, channels, or audio recordings <span style="color:#009C00">(highlighted in green)</span>. If you click one of the links in the navigation bar, then the page will scroll down to that section (which will be in one of the three columns for displays that are at least 800 pixels wide). As per its name, the goal of this website is to create the most rational philosophy ever with Zero Contradictions, or to at least do my best at that. In a single sentence, my philosophy is based on rationalism and understanding the implications of the subject-object dichotomy and applied evolutionary theory, among other things.
            <br><br>

        <p>This book debunks the Richard Dawkins' concept of the selfish gene, which situates biological purpose in genes, rather than the organism as a whole. The author presents an alternative theory of biological purpose that is more consistent with the evidence: the phenocentric view.</p></li>

        <p>Violence is inescapable from life due to the war, disease, and famine that are inevitably caused when a population reaches its carrying capacity. Eliminating violence within a society simply pushes the violence outwards. </p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2015/04/altruism-and-selfishness.html">Why Selfishness Always Beats Altruism</a> | <a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QoiEMN-dBY">Video Version</a>
        <p>People will use and define "altruism" and "selfishness" in confusing ways, but the most coherent definition of "altruism" always loses to the most coherent definition of "selfishness", energetically, biologically, and psychologically.</p></li>
    <li><a class="videos" href="https://odysee.com/@BlitheringGenius:2/BiologicalRealism:b">Biological Realism</a> | <a class="ZC-essays" href="FAQs/morality-FAQs#biorealism">Summary</a>
        <p>People ignore many aspects of human biology nowadays for moral reasons: the inherit violence and selfishness of life, sex realism, race realism, dysgenics/eugenics, and social/psychological realism. Most ideologies are therefore incongruent with reality.</p></li>
    <li><a class="videos" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K97OP2p9JTQ">Pathological Altruism</a> | <a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2016/12/pathological-altruism.html">Text Version</a>
        <p>Pathological Altruism is a phenomenon of collective irrationality caused by social delusion, and a virtue-signaling tragedy of the commons.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/07/kin-selection-theory-is-wrong.html">Why Kin Selection Theory is Wrong</a>
        <p>There is little evidence of kin altruism in nature, other than parental care of offspring. Kin Altruism is a myth used to justify collectivist ideologies.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/01/rk-selection-theory-is-bogus.html">r/K Selection Theory is Bogus</a>
        <p>r/K Selection Theory is fallacious and has no explanatory power. The second half of this essay gives a great explanation of how evolution actually works.</p></li>

        <p>Addressing the common misconceptions and implications of race, race realism, race-mixing, and ethnostates from a biological realist perspective. Race realism is a scientific position that acknowledges evolutionary differences and does not imply racism nor tribalism.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/06/its-probably-mostly-genetic.html">Why Most Racial Disparaties Are Probably Mostly Genetic</a>
        <p>Blithering Genius argues why the environmental factors affecting racial disparaties are highly dependent on genes, especially since most people in the Modern West are not lacking any important environmental input to their development.</p></li>

    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2017/05/does-evolutionary-theory-imply-genetic.html">Does Evolutionary Theory Imply Genetic Tribalism?</a>
        <p>Evolution creates reproducing machines, not entities with genetic interests. Cooperating with others can create a bigger machine (a society) that benefits its members, but every individual's participation in that machine is conditional and selfish, not an expression of a greater purpose. Racial tribalism does not fit the biological or historical evidence.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2019/01/sex-death-and-complexity.html">Sex, Death, and Complexity</a>
        <p>Sex, death and complexity are all linked. Death is a consequence of entropy and evolution. The dynamics of sexual reproduction force the cells of the body to work together, rather than competing against each other. This is arguably the most important reason why sexual reproduction evolved.</p></li>

        <p>The key traits that set humans apart from other great apes (bipedalism, tool use, social organization, and a larger brain) are all linked to changes in the human diet and the evolution that resulted from it.</p></li>

        <p>Evolution has many implications about morality. The simplest resolution to the conflicts between evolution and morality is to discard morality, but unfortunately it is easier for most people to reject the truth about life than to reject morality.</p></li>

        <p>The causes of (male) homosexuality are not fully understood, but one possible cause that hasn't been explored very well is intestinal pathogens.

        <p>Biological value is what is good or bad for an organism. Psychological value is a mental judgment of what is good or bad for an individual, from their subjective perspective. Social value judgments are intersubjective. And philosophical value is defined by an explicit philosophical theory of value.</p></li>

        <p>An ideology is a system of ideas that defines a social and moral dichotomy between <em>us</em> and <em>them</em>, <em>good</em> and <em>evil</em>. Everyone knows that the other group's ideology is crazy and that the other group is hypocritical, but they can't see those things about their own ideology and themselves.</p></li>

        <p>Most moral narratives revolve around Us Vs Them and Good Vs Evil, used by people for justification of their ideologies since the narratives fit their social instincts and worldview conditioned by the media. They are similar to the Walt Disney movies like the Lion King.</p></li>

        <p>The moral framework of altruism does not lead to actual altruism. It leads to individuals seeking power through victimhood and eventual social collapse.</p></li>
    <li><a href="https://thewaywardaxolotl.blogspot.com/2020/09/morality-and-bad-faith.html">Morality and Bad Faith</a>
        <p>Morality generates a complex web of pretense, deception, and delusion, for both individuals and collectives. This resulting bad faith prevents us from understanding and speaking the truth about nature, society, human nature, and our own motivations.</p></li>
